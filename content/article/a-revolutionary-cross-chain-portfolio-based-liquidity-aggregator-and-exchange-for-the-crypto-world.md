---

Blueshift is a cross-chain portfolio-based liquidity aggregator and exchange that aims to bring cross-chain swaps and liquidity to the Cardano ecosystem. There are many issues and barriers to gaining mass adoption across the entire cryptocurrency industry and we have a solution to provide cross-chain movement of assets without using bridges and wrapped assets.

## Crypto Mass Adoption

The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies relies on the seamless ability to hold, stake, and trade tokens in a convenient, reliable, and efficient manner. While centralised exchanges (CEXs) offer such user experiences, they often compromise the ownership of tokens, leaving users dependent on third parties and vulnerable to various risks. On the other hand, decentralised finance (DeFi) provides true ownership and full utility of tokens through non-custodial wallets and smart contract-based applications (dApps). However, the need for interoperability among different blockchains hinders the broader adoption of DeFi. The crypto industry increasingly focuses on interoperability, enabling blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data, messages, and tokens seamlessly.

## Fragmentation and Siloed Ecosystems 

The DeFi landscape is currently fragmented and isolated, with separate ecosystems on different blockchains. Each ecosystem has its own technological stack, infrastructure, protocols, wallets, and communities, limiting the potential of DeFi. While committed communities thrive within specific ecosystems, the broader adoption of DeFi suffers due to the barriers between these isolated ecosystems. The existing connections between ecosystems are often fragile bridges that enable token transfers through lock/burn- and mint mechanisms, resulting in wrapped and synthetic tokens. However, these bridges have proven less secure and susceptible to attacks, resulting in significant losses. To fully unlock the potential of DeFi, more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly connections are necessary.

## The Issues of the Non-Interoperable 

In addition to fragmentation, the need for interoperability presents liquidity-related challenges. Liquidity is dispersed, meaning only a fraction of assets is accessible to users. Availability depends on the affiliation with specific ecosystems and the preferences of the respective communities. This limitation restricts users' choices to tokens native to a particular blockchain and stablecoins. Moreover, liquidity needs to be more cohesive across different ecosystems, resulting in inefficiencies and obstacles in performing transactions. High fees and processing times further hinder the user experience in DeFi operations.

Financial risks arise from the dependency on DEXs, lending protocols, and other projects on the success of their ecosystems. The aggregated liquidity and overall ecosystem support determine the liquidity projects can secure. Technological risks emerge when adopting cross-chain approaches, as they must make decisions regarding the underlying system and the extent of their cross-chain development. Security risks are prevalent due to intermediaries, multiple interfaces, and potential breaches, jeopardising the safety of funds and sensitive information.

## The Trilemma of Interoperability 

Solving the challenges of interoperability requires careful trade-offs in terms of generalisability, extensibility, and trustlessness. Generalisability refers to the depth of interoperability, allowing various data transfers between chains beyond just tokens. It enables projects to function and communicate seamlessly, synchronising data, tokens, smart contracts, and governance models across chains. Extensibility, on the other hand, focuses on the breadth of interoperability, enabling the seamless addition of new chains to an interoperable network. Each chain has its unique architecture and set of players, including bridges, wallets, and protocols. Lastly, trustlessness minimises intermediaries' involvement in blockchain communication, ensuring users' control over their assets and actions. Reducing intermediaries and interfaces mitigates the risk of breaches and intrusive interferences.

## Blueshift Brings an Answer for Interoperability to the DeFi Space

Blueshift, a cutting-edge decentralised exchange (DEX), empowers users to trade cryptocurrencies seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks. Built on the well-established Milkomeda platform and connected with its newly developed layer-0 protocol BluesChain built on the Cosmos SDK, Blueshift boasts cross-chain capabilities that facilitate efficient liquidity movement, streamlined swaps, and single-token liquidity provisioning.

## Blueshift’s Innovations

Blueshift has always been at the forefront of technological developments in the DeFi space and Cardano/Milkomeda in particular. Blueshift's portfolio approach based on and combined with several innovative features, including single-sided token liquidity provision, internal pricing oracles, virtual pairs, and controllable minting schedules, has always been a key differentiator in the marketplace and driver of Blueshifts market dominance, especially on Milkomeda/Cardano. Blueshift users benefit from up to 10x lower impermanent loss, 2-10x lower price slippage, and a simplified user experience that will now be extended to cross-chain applications. 

### Cross-Chain Swaps

Blueshift takes the world of decentralised exchanges to new heights with its remarkable cross-chain capabilities, made possible through the development of BluesChain using the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK, a highly regarded framework for building application-specific blockchains, empowers Blueshift to create a robust and versatile infrastructure that enables seamless interaction between multiple blockchain networks.

By harnessing the power of the Cosmos SDK and BluesChain, Blueshift can offer its users a streamlined and interconnected experience that transcends the limitations of traditional decentralised exchanges. Users can now effortlessly engage with various blockchain networks and take advantage of their unique features and opportunities, all within the Blueshift ecosystem. Users can perform cross-chain swaps in 10 seconds via possible routes on connected chains.

## Ecosystems/Roadmap

As the Blueshift ecosystem expands, our team will continue incorporating more chains. More chains will enhance the liquidity available from vetted projects being developed within these ecosystems, attracting a wider user base and further bolstering liquidity.

Blueshift is integrated with the Milkomeda Cardano C1 sidechain, the Milkomeda Algorand A1 rollup, the Kava EVM, and Polygon.

As the progress of our partnership matures, our team will begin branching out to other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-based chains and ecosystems. This expansion will include chains like the BNB Chain, among others.

In addition to directly connecting with various chains, Blueshift fosters partnerships with pivotal ecosystem projects to curate ecosystem portfolios. These portfolios consist of top-tier project tokens from specific ecosystems.

These ecosystem portfolios offer users, even those with limited time or experience in various ecosystems, to gain exposure to vetted projects being developed on those respective chains.

An exemplification of this concept can be found in indices like the Cardano Index. This index comprises key projects built on the Cardano chain, specifically those aiming to extend their reach cross-chain and evolve into interoperable projects.

## Cross-Chain Applications
