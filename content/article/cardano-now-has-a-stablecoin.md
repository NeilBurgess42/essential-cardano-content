[Shareslake](https://www.shareslake.com) has been working hard during the year to open the Cardano technology to those use cases in which the typical crypto volatility is not an option.

On May 1st, 2022, the Shareslake network was released as a fork of Cardano. It has the peculiarity to run on top of Redeemable, a fiat-backed stablecoin that is designed to be not just a common stablecoin, but to preserve people purchasing power over time. The Shareslake network supports all the same features as Cardano, but the transaction fees are paid using Redeemable instead of ADA. The Redeemable can be staked just like ADA is on Cardano mainnet and anyone can [deploy their own pool](https://github.com/shareslake/pool-deployment) and start to earn this new stablecoin.

Recently, on September 26th, the [Shareslake bridge](https://bridge.shareslake.com) opened its doors, **bringing the Redeemable coin to Cardano as** **the first ever Cardano stablecoin**. The bridge allows moving Redeemable between Shareslake and Cardano networks, joining both ecosystems to power the Cardano DeFi landscape.

Currently, there are two main ways of obtaining Redeemable. To get new Redeemables in Shareslake, it has to be done through the [Shareslake dashboard](https://dashboard.shareslake.com), which adds the USD to the fiat reserve and mints the new equivalent Redeemable. If you are a Cardano user, using the [Minswap pool](https://app.minswap.org/swap?currencySymbolA=&tokenNameA=&currencySymbolB=cd5b9dd91319edbb19477ad00cbef673a221e70a17ef043951fc6786&tokenNameB=52656465656d61626c65) is the most direct option, in which you can swap ADA by RED. When using Redeemable in Cardano always remember to check the policy id: `cd5b9dd91319edbb19477ad00cbef673a221e70a17ef043951fc678652656465656d61626c65`
