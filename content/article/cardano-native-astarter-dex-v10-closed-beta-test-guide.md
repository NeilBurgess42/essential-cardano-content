# **2\. Purchase ADA:**

Before testing, there has to be some ADA in your Cardano wallet for testing and transaction fee, the amount of ADA is not limited. If you do not have ADA in your Wallet, please buy on [BINANCE](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ADA_USDT?ref=40896146&theme=dark&type=spot). Besides, please notice that the maximum of each transaction is 10 ADA during our test. Please pay attention to your privacy and asset security.

# **3\. ADEX Major Function Test**

**_You should know before the test:_**

**_Please notice that to ensure the safety of your assets, we have set the Maximum transaction limit at 10 Ada during the test._**

**_Nami and Yoroi are incompatible. When you use one, remember to turn off the other on the manage extensions page._**

The key functions of ADEX beta are Swap, Add liquidity, and Withdraw liquidity. Please enter the [ADEX website](https://dex.astarter.io/), connect your wallet, and start the test.
