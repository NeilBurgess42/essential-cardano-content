🏕️Live Coding takes place all weds and thrus, 14:30 UTC

We've got 7 weeks left to close out 2023.

Right now, we have space to 👩‍🔬experiment.

Maybe we'll keep running the sessions just like we have been. Or maybe, we'll make a 🏄‍♀️seasonal shift from the kind of guided-onboarding that we've been doing ↗️toward a more intentional collaboration. Please bring your intentions to tomorrow's session - we'll have some time to align on what each of us wants to accomplish.
