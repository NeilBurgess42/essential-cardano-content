## ðŸ›£ **Open Spaces** are collaborative sessions where you work alongside fellow builders to learn, experiment, and bring ideas to life.

Whether you want to run a Cardano node, improve docs, ask questions or start a project, the OS sessions make it easy to start small and grow.

Don't just watch the future unfold - help create it!
