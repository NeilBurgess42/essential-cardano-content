## Atala PRISM

Identity is key to accessing a range of private and public services. From opening a bank account to obtaining loans or a driver's license, access to education, etc., the need to prove to others who we are is almost omnipresent in everyday life.  

Atala PRISM is IOG’s decentralized identity solution. It enables people to own their personal data and interact with organizations seamlessly, privately, and securely. Visit the [Atala PRISM website](https://www.atalaprism.io/app) for more information.
