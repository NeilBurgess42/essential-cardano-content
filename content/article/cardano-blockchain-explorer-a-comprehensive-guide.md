Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project that is focused on providing a secure and scalable platform for the development of applications. One important tool for interacting with the Cardano blockchain is a blockchain explorer, which allows users to view and search for information on the blockchain.

In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to our Cardano blockchain explorer and explain how it can be used to access various types of information on the blockchain.

### What is a Cardano Blockchain Explorer?

A Cardano blockchain explorer is a web-based tool that allows users to view and search for information on the Cardano blockchain. It is similar to a search engine, but instead of searching the internet, it searches the Cardano blockchain.

The explorer allows users to view transactions, blocks, and other information on the blockchain in real-time. It also provides detailed information about each transaction, including the sender and recipient addresses, the amount of ADA (Cardano's native cryptocurrency) transferred, and the fees paid.

### Using the [Cardano Explorer - cexplorer.io](https://cexplorer.io/)

There are several ways to use the Cardano blockchain explorer. Here are some common use cases:

*   **Viewing transaction history:** The explorer allows users to view the complete transaction history for a specific address. This can be useful for tracking the movement of ADA/Tokens/NFTs or for checking the balance of an address.
    
*   [Searching for a specific transaction](https://cexplorer.io/tx)**:** If you know the transaction ID or the block number, you can use the explorer to search for a specific transaction or block. This can be useful for verifying the status of a transaction or for getting more information about a specific block.
    
*   [Monitoring the performance of the network](https://cexplorer.io/usage)**:** The explorer can be used to monitor the performance of the Cardano network, including the rate at which blocks are being added to the blockchain and the average transaction fees and many more cool features.
    
*   [Viewing the code of smart contracts](https://cexplorer.io/dapps)**:** If a smart contract has been deployed on the Cardano blockchain, the explorer can be used to view the code of the contract and see how it is being used.
    
*   [Advanced analytics tools](https://cexplorer.io/insights)**:** A lot of numerous analytical graphs and comparisons (onchain + offchain)
