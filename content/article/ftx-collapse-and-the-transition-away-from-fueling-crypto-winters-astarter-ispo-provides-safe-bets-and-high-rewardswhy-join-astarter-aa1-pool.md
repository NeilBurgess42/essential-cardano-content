> _Ada has stable and strong support in wake of the FTX collapse. Let Astarter help you to steadily raise assets and fall in love with Cardano._

Crypto markets are experiencing crisis upon crisis, in the wake of the recent collapse of centralized exchange FTX, with the impact across the whole crypto market, especially for those tied to FTX caught in the domino effect seeing shock waves hitting centralized exchanges across the space.

It all began with a CoinDesk report revealing at least $5 billion of Alameda Research’s $14.6 billion balance sheet in FTT and another significant portion in illiquid altcoins. Alameda Research is a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm that provides liquidity for FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.

The report naturally raised user concerns for FTX, and a run ensued as Binance announced its intention to sell $500 million FTT. However, Binance CEO CZ (Changpeng Zhao) stepped in further, announcing talks to acquire FTX a few days later. The market felt a little optimistic, but Binance abandoned the idea of any offer, and the liquidity crunch poses solvency risks for FTX. Finally, FTX collapsed.

Dragged down by the crash of FTX, Solana, once considered one of the promising cryptocurrencies, is also impacted. Data shows that since the FTX turmoil began on November 2, the price of Solana’s token (sol) fell significantly compared to Ethereum (eth) and Bitcoin (btc) in the same period. As you can imagine, other coins also saw declines, and the crypto winter turned colder overall.

However, while many tokens/coins suffered a significant decline, an exceptional case emerged — the Cardano (ada) price analysis showed strong support. According to Adaverse News, Cardano’s updates provider, ada’s Daily Active Address (DAA), saw considerable increases by 400% on November 13.

Reports and data suggest that the turmoil and uncertainty surrounding centralized exchanges are behind outflows to self-custody wallets amongst a chorus of **_“not your keys, not your crypto”_**.

**Not your keys not your crypto**

The market conditions are creating a climate for ada as a secure crypto asset held in non-custodial wallets.

Ada held on-chain through non-custodial wallets is an opportunity for users to experience DeFi. Enter Astarter DeFi infrastructure hub on Cardano and live staking to Astarter AA1 stake pool.

Astarter is a smart-contract system on the Cardano blockchain that implements a suite of key product features, including Launchpool, Launchpad, Astarter Decentralized Exchange (ADEX), Money Market, and Tech Service.

The Astarter Decentralized Exchange platform (ADEX) helps Cardano ada users avoid risks such as the FTX centralized fund control. Astarter Money Market is a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending. DeFi enables users to retain ownership of their funds.

Furthermore, Launchpool and Launchpad form the perfect bridge between projects and investors. Enabling the project’s access to funding through the ISPO and IDO mechanisms, the Tech Service Platform also provides strong technical support and diverse technical resources for projects, promotes the production of various products in the ecosystem, and optimizes the user experiences on Cardano.

We can say that Astarter contributes to the stability of Cardano with its core functions, making the crypto experience for Cardano users more secure and decentralized, providing investment options with better returns.

## **Invest wisely in Cardano: ISPO**

We have indeed seen that support for Cardano remains stable despite market turmoil. And while there are many contributing factors for the support, it is without a doubt that Cardano’s ada token Proof-of-Stake (PoS) utility is a major contributing factor. The consensus mechanism, Oraborous, drastically reduces the resources used compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains such as Bitcoin. One of the popular innovations in Cardano’s PoS is the Initial Staking Pool Offering (ISPO). Investing in ISPO is a sensible choice for Cardano.

**Stage 1: AA1 Pool (We are here)**

Stage 1 enables the community to accumulate native AA tokens for merge staking in ISPO Stage 2. ISPO stage1 was launched at Epoch 366 in Sept 2022, and check more details on Stage 1: [Astarter ISPO Stage1 Launch](https://medium.com/astarter/astarter-ispo-stage1-launch-1350f4e36c53)

**Stage 2: Merge Staking Protocol**

This stage enables the staking of AA tokens, that when combined with delegating to a staking pool, earns AA tokens on top of ada.

## **What does AA1 Stake Pool bring?**

AA1 Stake Pool (AA1) is the first Astarter official staking pool for liquidity provision during Stage 1. AA1 will facilitate the fundraising of Launchpool ISPO services for projects on Astarter, creating a win-win environment and a vibrant ecosystem for principals and startups. Maybe some readers have already chosen our ISPO in Stage 1, and we do suggest and appeal to more users to pay attention to the AA1 pool before Stage 2. Let’s see what notable benefits AA1 can bring to users:

**Multiplied rewards and high APY**

Last month, the Astarter community launched the [AA1 Stake Pool Block Genesis Series Campaign](https://medium.com/astarter/aa1-stake-pool-block-genesis-series-campaign-ec7626359803) to share Astarter ISPO pool ada rewards with Astartees. It allows Astartees to receive ada rewards while enjoying additional benefits from their contributions as a delegator. Delegating in AA1 can not only receive high returns but also participate in a series of community campaigns and obtain multiple rewards. As the delegated amount increases in Stage 1 and liquidity increases, APY will rise in Stage 2 Merge staking. It’s hard to find other competing protocols with such a dynamic method for higher APY.

## [Astarter: Introducing a Framework for Merge Staking Protocol Rewards.](https://medium.com/astarter/astarter-introducing-a-framework-for-merge-staking-protocol-rewards-95689a0ed4db)

There are many reasons for developing a two-stage ISPO, for instance, to incentivize both ada and AA staking for…

**Secure and Decentralized**

Our ISPO has a much longer timeframe than venture capital seed or private sale rounds. During this period, you can see active updates of news and technical changes from the Astarter community. We maintain close contact with Astartees with our community-first approach. At the same time, delegators can remove their delegation from the AA1 pool and get their assets back at any time, which means you have full ownership and control of delegated assets. Not only will your delegated principal not decrease, but you can also enjoy high rewards and completely free decentralized asset management.

**Bringing advantages for entering Stage 2**

The development of the second stage in which users can get Merge Staking Protocol (MSP) rewards requires AA. ada Delegators participating in Stage 1 to accumulate AA tokens will have more benefits in Stage 2. In Stage 2, users can not only delegate ada, but also stake AA, and even obtain more high-yield investment portfolios through the Merge Staking Protocol.

## **Conclusion**

The ISPO launched by Astarter has been discussed, practiced, and optimized, bringing better choices to projects and users in the ecosystem. Under the stable Cardano ecosystem, investing in AA1 on Astarter is a step forward in transitioning from the centralization that fuels crypto winters towards a more transparent decentralized future of next-level DeFi.
