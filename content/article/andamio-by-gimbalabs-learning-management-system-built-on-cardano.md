As the name suggests, Gimbalabs ([https://gimbalabs.com/](https://gimbalabs.com/gimbalgrid)) is essentially a lab. In the last three years, we have been experimenting with _Learning-By-Doing_ experiences and infrastructure that facilitates them.

So since the first version of one of our main programs, the [Gimbalabs Plutus Project-Based Learning](https://plutuspbl.io/), we focused our efforts on the creation of _Project-Based Learning_ methodologies, trusting the delivering of our educational final result to _Canvas_, a well-known web-based learning management system (LMS), used by learning institutions, educators, and students to access and manage online course learning.

[Canvas](https://www.canvas.net/) has been used extensively by organizations like IOG, for example, for delivering its Pioneers and Haskell courses. But throughout our time there, we noted some things:

*   It’s expensive.
    
*   It’s about _grades tracking_ instead of _contributions tracking._
    
*   It doesn't have a _credential generation feature_ based on tamper-proof technology.
    
*   It doesn’t have a Treasury system to compensate and stimulate Learner’s contributions.
    

> In essence, governance components that we have in an advanced state of maturity in the Cardano ecosystem.

So, starting from our own urgencies as educators, and as a way to prove that at Cardano we can create better systems than legacy and traditional solutions, we built _our own Learning Management System (LMS)_ with contribution tracking and credential creation features based on a first Smart Contracts scaffold, initially to teach Cardano development. **The first LMS built on Cardano.**

Today, with the MVP stage finished, the next step is to incorporate the _Gimbalabs LMS_ into a more robust environment in terms of Smart Contract’s fabric that provides:

*   Contribution tracking
    
*   Credentials creation
    
*   a Treasury system to stimulate and compensate learners contributions.
    

Pieces working together for a single purpose: to turn students into contributors, whose main tool in their toolbox is: _collaboration_.

That’s the origin of **Andamio**.

![andamio.io](https://ucarecdn.com/3d3972c7-746c-4aed-b528-9c6514c3b1f5/)

So we went from the static Learning proposition of Canvas to the dynamic Learning experience proposition of Andamio. For the world, not only for Cardano.

The final result: a platform that makes it easy for people and organizations inside and outside of Cardano to share onboarding and educational resources while enjoying Governance features native to Cardano.

This is our first version of Andamio, still under development:

![The word “Andamio” is a Spanish word that translates as “Scaffold”.](https://ucarecdn.com/7cffbfc2-c1ec-4b72-9863-b48c7ec54496/)

Our main goal is to make it more and more user-friendly so that people will just only need to create their material and the platform will integrate automatically to it Contribution tracking, Credentials creation, and Treasury system features.

> This all came out of our experience with Canvas. As a Lab, Zoom could be our next target.
