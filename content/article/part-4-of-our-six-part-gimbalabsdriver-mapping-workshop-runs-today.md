Yesterday we drafted a shared "Why" statement for Gimbalabs in 2024. Here it is:

> To provide open, replicable, safe spaces to learn, explore, and empower individuals and organizations anywhere so that we can solve meaningful problems.

What do you think about it?

Today, we will build upon this statement by asking:

🙋‍♀️ Who will be impacted?

🙋‍♂️ What is needed in order to deliver on this "Why"?

Don't worry if you cannot make it to every meeting, or if you missed last week's meetings - you are welcome to jump in, and in classic Gimbalabs fashion, we'll keep making progress with everyone who shows up. All meeting recordings will be posted here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hEnT1kfo2YGdQv-Bdo6HOXLT1nDNHqLd?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hEnT1kfo2YGdQv-Bdo6HOXLT1nDNHqLd?usp=sharing)
