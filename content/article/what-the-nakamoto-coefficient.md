**How decentralized is Cardano?**

There is no clear answer to this question, but there are established metrics for decentralization. One such metric is the Edinburgh Index, which is rooted in scientific research. It even features an open source tool for analyzing a handful of blockchains.

However there is no widespread adoption of this index. Instead the predominant metric appears to be the Nakamoto Coefficient, which is a parameter in the Edinburgh Index. There are various numbers floating around the internet, but none are officially recognized by IOG, the CF or Emurgo.

Meanwhile Solana proclaims its blockchain to be the most decentralized.

If you are interested in this topic I can recommend taking a look at the technical report from the University of Edinburgh. They go into a lot of detail regarding the manyfold challenges related to decentralization.

Also we are proposing a marketing offensive around Cardano's Nakamoto Coefficient on Project Catalyst and would appreciate your support.
