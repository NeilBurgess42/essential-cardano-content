[The EUTXO Handbook](https://ucarecdn.com/3da33f2f-73ac-4c9b-844b-f215dcce0628/EUTXOhandbook_for_EC.pdf)

There currently are two major accounting ledgers in the blockchain space: UTXO-based blockchains (Bitcoin, for instance), and Account/Balance chains (Ethereum and others).

Cardano combines Bitcoinâ€™s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model with the ability to handle smart contracts into an Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) accounting model. Cardano leverages EUTXO to facilitate the implementation of smart contracts and a deterministic transaction mechanism, among many other advantages.

Vasil also leverages EUTXO to optimize both smart contracts and transactions, so this is the perfect time to take a deep dive into EUTXO with [this Handbook](https://ucarecdn.com/3da33f2f-73ac-4c9b-844b-f215dcce0628/EUTXOhandbook_for_EC.pdf).
