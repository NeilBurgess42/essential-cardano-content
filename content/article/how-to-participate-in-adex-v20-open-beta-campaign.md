We are thrilled to announce that Astarter has reached an exciting milestone in our journey. Since the successful completion of the ADEX V1 Closed Beta, we have been diligently working to bring you the most advanced version yet — **ADEX V2.0!**

ADEX V2.0 introduces groundbreaking features and significant updates that will revolutionize your decentralized exchange experience. We have listened to your feedback and made remarkable improvements to enhance the platform’s efficiency, flexibility, and overall user experience. We cannot wait to share it with you!

To celebrate this achievement and show our gratitude, we’re kicking off the 3-week ‘ADEX V2 Open Beta Campaign’. This exclusive event invites you to explore and test the enhanced capabilities of ADEX V2. Participating in this campaign also brings you the chance to secure valuable rewards.

**The ADEX V2.0 Open Beta Campaign unfolds across two phases:**

**Phase One**: From August 30th to September 6th, open to the Astarter community.

**Phase Two:** Running from September 7th to September 20th, this phase will see us partnering with 15–20 projects to amplify ADEX exposure and boost Cardano awareness.

The tasks for both phases are largely similar:
