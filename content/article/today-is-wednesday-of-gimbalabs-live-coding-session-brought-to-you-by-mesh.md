Learning Target of today's post: exploring how a marketplace built on Cardano works. Let's do it!  
  
1\. Go to [https://meshjs.dev/smart-contracts/marketplace](https://meshjs.dev/smart-contracts/marketplace)   
  
2\. Once there, go to "Try the demo" (you have to connect a "preprod" wallet. Don't know how to do it? No worries, go to [https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1001](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1001))

3\. Go and try "List Asset"  
  
4\. Go and try "Buy Asset"  
  
5\. Go to "Update Listing"  
  
6\. Go to "Cancel Listing".  
  
And that's it. Easy peasy. Congratulations!.
