image_text: New CNFT analyzer
---

We have recently published a new tool that we are actively developing for the Cardano community. It is called [ADAmarket.io](//adamarket.io) and it is a free automated tool that analyzes nft metadata, trading data and calculates uniqueness and other properties.

![](https://ucarecdn.com/cccedf3a-7b3b-4da3-88ac-7df363312293/-/preview/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/)We are running the site more or less in silent mode, as it still contains a lot of things that need to be fixed, finished or new features added, for which we are still collecting data day-by-day, but as an early beta, why not now.

We are officially planning to launch within two months. We will be glad for any feedback on our [cardano cnft tool](https://adamarket.io).
