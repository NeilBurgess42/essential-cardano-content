**Sustainable ADA and Positive Blockchain (PB) have partnered up to add to the value and impact of the PB database.**

Together we will be mapping the Cardano projects which have positive social and environmental impacts, and co-producing blockchain4good principles to help guide our global movement, working together towards a sustainable and equitable world for all.

[Sustainable ADA](https://www.sustainableada.com/) is a space where you can learn more about the transformative potential and impact of Cardano & collaborate with others to receive guidance, access to tools, and community support while integrating solutions to challenges faced by you, your business, or your community.

[PositiveBlockchain.io](//PositiveBlockchain.io) is the open-source database, media platform, and community exploring the potential of blockchain technologies for social and environmental impact.
