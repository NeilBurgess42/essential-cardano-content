# Hi everyone. At Gimbalabs Open Spaces we experiment not only with code, but also with tools that can contribute to create more focused and creative organizations.

That's how in yesterday's OS we played a little bit with _Notion_, a true all-in-one tool. Check this out: [https://www.youtube.com/live/m5XieJ8bsm8?si=g1NEH7CUpW9xvv3n&t=1508](https://www.youtube.com/live/m5XieJ8bsm8?si=g1NEH7CUpW9xvv3n&t=1508)

What's in store for today's Gimbalabs Open Space, March 28th? We don't really know: 👩‍🔬more experimentation, 🤿more playing, but most of all, 🏗️more collaboration and meaningful contribution.

👅Join us! Link to invite: [https://gimbalabs.com/calendar](https://gimbalabs.com/calendar)

Best,

Gimbalabs team
