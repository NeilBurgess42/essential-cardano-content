[Gimbalabs'](https://gimbalabs.com/gimbalgrid) mission, in the words of Gimbalabs co-founder, **James Dunseith**, is to, "demystify Tech and raise our general level of tech literacy, because if it's a black box to you, if you don't know what you're doing, people are going to take advantage of you."
