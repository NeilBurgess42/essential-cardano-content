Cardano is an open-source, proof-of-stake, public blockchain, the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and development through evidence-based methods. This approach positions Cardano uniquely among other blockchain platforms. A set of the best practices, ideas, and research contributions formed Cardano’s foundation for building a secure, decentralized, and scalable ledger. 

There is now a substantial body of research, represented by Input Output Global’s [extensive library of papers](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/). 

We have discussed several papers and research initiatives that led Cardano’s development since 2015:

### 1\. [Cardano's foundational research overview](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/cardanos-foundational-research-overview)

This post takes a closer look at the research underpinning Cardano. It discusses the uniqueness of the Ouroboros consensus protocols and provides an overview of staking, delegation, and reward sharing.

### 2\. [Overview of the research enabling smart contract support on Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/overview-of-the-research-enabling-smart-contract-support-on-cardano)

Smart contracts are the driving force behind deal execution on Cardano. The post explains Cardano’s innovative EUTXO model and how it facilitates Plutus and Marlowe smart contracts.

### 3\. [Research overview part 3: tokens, stablecoins, and fees](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/research-overview-part-3-tokens-stablecoins-and-fees)

This post covers the research that enabled multi-asset support and the creation of various user-defined tokens on Cardano. It also discusses the benefits of [Babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/) implementation.

### 4\. [An analysis of the research underpinning Cardano's scalability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/an-analysis-of-the-research-underpinning-cardanos-scalability)

The final post looks into the research and ongoing initiatives that guide Cardano’s scalability and interoperability. In particular, the post explains how layer 1 and layer 2 solutions create a faster and more resilient blockchain.

_There are currently_ [over 150](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/) _papers hosted in the IOG research library, which is constantly growing. All the work has and will further lay the foundation before any feature or upgrade is deployed on Cardano._
