## Wallets

## Daedalus

Daedalus is a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) desktop wallet for ada. 

Daedalus comes bundled with a full Cardano node, so requires a relatively high-specification desktop machine for good performance. The wallet stores the entire history of the Cardano blockchain and validates all blocks and transactions for fully trustless and autonomous operation. Daedalus is ideal for those who want accurate blockchain data, but should not be the go-to wallet for everyday, minor transactions.

## Lace

The first version of [Lace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Z83TSdEfg) will provide a friendly and intuitive experience to:

*   securely store your funds
    
*   transact and make payments
    
*   store and view your non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
    
*   delegate stake
    
*   interact with different DApps
    

## Yoroi

[Yoroi](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet?s=20&t=sjacJxtxQ1kWELsD_k4FqA) is a light wallet for ada running as a browser extension. It connects to a full Cardano node hosted by a third party ([Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/)). 

Yoroi allows for instant initial setup, plus quick and easy operation with the minimum usage of system resources. It is also available as a mobile application.

## Hardware wallets
