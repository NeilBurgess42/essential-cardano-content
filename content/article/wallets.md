## Wallets

Cardano boasts of a thriving and very active developer community that has developed a number of compatible wallets. These include:

## Daedalus

[Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) is a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) desktop wallet for ada. 

Daedalus comes bundled with a full Cardano node, so requires a relatively high-specification desktop machine for good performance. The wallet stores the entire history of the Cardano blockchain and validates all blocks and transactions for fully trustless and autonomous operation. Daedalus is ideal for those who want accurate blockchain data, but should not be the go-to wallet for everyday, minor transactions.

## Lace

[Lace](https://www.lace.io) is a non-custodial Cardano wallet to explore Web3. With Lace, you can manage digital assets, access NFTs, connect to DApps and DeFi services, and multi-stake. Discover and enjoy a new world of digital experiences.

## Yoroi

## Eternl

[Eternl](https://eternl.io) is a Cardano light wallet that is available as a website/PWA, Chrome browser extension, and mobile app on iOS and Android. Here are a few of their key features:

## Nami Wallet
