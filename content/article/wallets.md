## Wallets

Cardano boasts of a thriving and very active developer community that has developed a number of compatible wallets. These include:

## Daedalus

[Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) is a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) desktop wallet for ada. 

Daedalus comes bundled with a full Cardano node, so requires a relatively high-specification desktop machine for good performance. The wallet stores the entire history of the Cardano blockchain and validates all blocks and transactions for fully trustless and autonomous operation. Daedalus is ideal for those who want accurate blockchain data, but should not be the go-to wallet for everyday, minor transactions.

## Lace

[Lace](https://www.lace.io) is a Cardano wallet to explore Web3. With Lace, you can manage digital assets, access NFTs, connect to DApps and DeFi services, and multi-stake. Discover and enjoy a new world of digital experiences.

## Yoroi

[Yoroi](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet?s=20&t=sjacJxtxQ1kWELsD_k4FqA) is a light wallet for ada running as a browser extension. It connects to a full Cardano node hosted by a third party, [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/). 

Yoroi allows for instant initial setup, plus quick and easy operation with the minimum usage of system resources. It is also available as a mobile application.

## Eternl

[Eternl](https://eternl.io) is a Cardano light wallet that is available as a website/PWA, Chrome browser extension, and mobile app on iOS and Android. Here are a few of their key features:

*   Ledger and Trezor Hardware Wallet support
    
*   DApp Browser to connect to the Cardano ecosystem
    
*   Smart UTxO management and Token Fragmentation
    

Eternl is focused on giving the user full access to Cardano's capabilities and is [actively engaging with the community](https://discord.gg/qpvMnz7Wwp) to further improve its features.

## Nami Wallet

[Nami Wallet](https://namiwallet.io/) is a non-custodial, browser-based wallet extension that interacts with the Cardano blockchain and connects with DApps. It allows users to send and store multiple assets, delegate ada, and more.

Nami [recently joined the IOG product family](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/11/01/nami-has-a-new-home/) and is fully compatible with Lace, but has limited compatibility with other wallets.

## Flint

[Flint](https://flint-wallet.com/)'s lightweight and user-friendly design lets you manage your crypto assets and access the world of DeFi with ease. The wallet currently supports sending and receiving assets on Cardano with Solana, Ethereum, and Urbit support coming soon.
