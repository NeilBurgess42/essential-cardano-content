Cardano is a third generation, open source, proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Its name derives from [Gerolamo Cardano](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Girolamo-Cardano), a mid-16th century Italian physician and mathematician. Third generation blockchain platforms are designed to resolve the issues that the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum) suffer from, including _scalability_ and _interoperability,_ while fulfilling an ambitious agenda of _decentralization._

The Cardano platform combines pioneering technologies based on peer-reviewed research to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and communities worldwide. Cardano is about openness, fairness, and inclusivity. 

The blockchain's proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution to accommodate millions – and ultimately, billions – of users worldwide.

Cardano's development is led by a deliberate approach to construct a robust and reliable enterprise-grade infrastructure.

### Commitment to decentralization

Decentralization is one of Cardano's main drivers, built around three central pillars:

*   Block production & consensus
    
*   Networking
    
*   Governance
    

These three elements combined form a fully decentralized environment where power shifts from monopolistic entities to the individual. Decentralization dissolves the concentration of power by enabling peers to make choices and decisions, and returning ownership of personal information where it belongs- with the users.

On March 31, 2021, Cardano's block production became fully decentralized. On that day, [the stake pool operator (SPO) community began producing 100% of new blocks](https://iog.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/31/decentralization-to-d-0-day-and-beyond/). This was an important milestone on the way to Cardano's ultimate destination; the creation of a platform wholly and democratically operated and controlled through a global community of SPOs, developers, and ada holders.
