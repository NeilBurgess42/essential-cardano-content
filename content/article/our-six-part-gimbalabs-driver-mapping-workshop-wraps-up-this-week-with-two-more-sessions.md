Both sessions will run from 1430-1600 UTC, on Zoom: [https://us06web.zoom.us/j/85669298711?pwd=FeVmtGabE5i73rsb6AN4K0GAhyiB7l.1](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/85669298711?pwd=FeVmtGabE5i73rsb6AN4K0GAhyiB7l.1)

Last week, we drafted a shared "Why" statement for Gimbalabs in 2024. Then, we asked:

**Who will be impacted?**  
**What is needed?**

This week, we will continue the üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èDriver Mapping process by asking:

**How can we respond?**  
**Who has expertise?**  
**How might we organize our work?**

Don't worry if you missed last week's meetings - you are welcome to jump in, and in classic Gimbalabs fashion, we'll keep making progress with everyone who shows up.

All meeting recordings will be posted here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hEnT1kfo2YGdQv-Bdo6HOXLT1nDNHqLd?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hEnT1kfo2YGdQv-Bdo6HOXLT1nDNHqLd?usp=sharing)
