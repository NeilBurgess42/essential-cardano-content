In _Live Coding_, you'll learn things like: **Minting your own assets**! The process involves:

1.  Go to [https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/minting](https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/minting)
    
2.  In the "Minting Assets" section, on the right side, you'll see a panel named "Mint assets and send to recipients". Just go there.
    
3.  Fill in the fields "Address", "Asset name", "Asset label" (what is "fungible"), and "Quantity".
    
4.  Connect your preprod Wallet ("preprod?")
    
5.  Click on "Run code snippet"


And voila! Tokens in your wallet!

And, one more thing: Start taking the Plutus PBL right now. [https://plutuspbl.io/](https://plutuspbl.io/)
