In _Live Coding_, you'll learn things like: **Minting your own assets**. Let's do it!:

1.  Go to [https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/minting](https://meshjs.dev/apis/transaction/minting)
    
2.  In the "Minting Assets" section, at the right side, you'll see a panel named "Mint assets and send to recipients". Just go there.
    
3.  Fill the fields "Address", "Asset name", "Asset label" (what is "fungible"), "Quantity".
    
4.  Connect your preprod Wallet ("preprod?")
    
5.  Click on "Run code snippet"
    

And voila! Tokens in your wallet!

## Question: did you feel the need to be a developer to start doing things in Cardano? Neither did we. **Come and learn a little bit more.**
