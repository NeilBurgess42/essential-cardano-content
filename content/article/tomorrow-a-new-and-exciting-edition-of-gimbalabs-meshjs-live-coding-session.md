But why exciting?

As long as it combines exploration and boldness, we can do whatever we want. For example, currently, with [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev/), we're building a front-end demo for [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/)'s game, Asteria: [https://github.com/gimbalabs/mesh-asteria-demo-app](https://github.com/gimbalabs/mesh-asteria-demo-app)

Join us on this journey.
