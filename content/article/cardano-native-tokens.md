Cardano native tokens allow anyone to create and transact digital assets with ease, directly on the blockchain, leading to a growing ecosystem of unique projects. But how do Cardano's native assets differ from ones on other blockchains, and how can you mint your own?

Read on to learn about:

*   what Cardano native tokens are,
    
*   their benefits and use cases,
    
*   how they differ from other tokens,
    
*   and how they're made.
    

Let’s dive in!

## What are Cardano native tokens?

Introduced through the Mary protocol upgrade on February 24, 2021, [Cardano native tokens](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/native-tokens) were a significant innovation within the blockchain industry. While other blockchains require the use of smart contracts to mint tokens, Cardano supports creating and transacting tokens natively on the ledger.

Whereas Bitcoin was only designed to be a digital currency, and Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts allowing developers to build their own decentralized applications (DApps), Cardano took it one step further by removing the need for custom code in creating DApps. This eliminates an entire layer of complexity present in other chains, as well as costs and the risk of human error.

A public distributed ledger like Cardano is intended to track only one type of digital asset (ada). However, as the ledger evolves and becomes more decentralized, there comes a need and possibility to track multiple types of assets using the same infrastructure. This is the reason why some blockchains now support various digital assets, including:

*   stablecoins
    
*   utility tokens
    
*   credential tokens
    
*   security tokens, etc
    

To allow for transaction processing with different types of assets concurrently, the native token functionality extends the accounting infrastructure that is initially defined in the ledger model.

It is important to note that native tokens and Cardano’s currency, [ada](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ada), differ in two ways:

*   Native tokens can be created and destroyed, while ada can’t.
    
*   Only ada can be used to pay transaction fees and distribute staking rewards.
    

## How do Cardano native tokens differ from other tokens?

Cardano native tokens differ from other tokens in several ways, as illustrated in the table below.

## How to create a native token on Cardano

Creating a native token on Cardano is a straightforward process if you follow these steps:

Once a native token is created, it can be sent and received like ada. 

[The Cardano Transaction Metadata (CMT)](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/transaction-metadata/) feature enables issuers to add information to their native tokens by including metadata within a transaction that specifies the:

*   Name
    
*   Symbol
    
*   Icon
    
*   Amount of tokens
    
*   Cardano wallet address
    
*   And monetary policy
    

## Use cases for native tokens

Native tokens have a range of use cases, including:

*   [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/defi-demystified)**:** Used to create decentralized financial instruments such as [stablecoins](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stablecoin), which can be used as a store of value or a means of payment.
    
*   **Gaming:** Used to create in-game items tradable on decentralized marketplaces.
    
*   **Collectibles:** Used to create, store, and transact unique digital art efficiently.
    
*   **Identity token:** Used to create [decentralized identities](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/decentralized-identity), which enable secure authentication and verification of their issuers, and handle user permissions for different actions.
    
*   **Smart contract assurance:** Used as an important tool in the building of reliable smart contracts.
    

## Why are native tokens important?

Native tokens are important for several reasons:

*   They represent a significant advancement in the Cardano ecosystem, as they provide a fast, efficient, and customizable way to create and transact both fungible and non-fungible assets. 
    
*   Native tokens can be used for a wide range of innovative purposes.
    
*   They provide a powerful, flexible, and decentralized approach to democratizing access to digital assets and promoting financial inclusion.
