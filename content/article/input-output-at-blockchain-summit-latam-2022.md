We’re delighted to announce that Input Output Global (IOG) will be represented at this year’s [Blockchain Summit Latam (BSL) conference](https://www.blockchainsummit.la/) by [Marshia Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marshiamartinezr/), project manager in IOG’s Professional Services Group (PSG). 

## What is Blockchain Summit Latam?

Blockchain Summit Latam (BSL) is one of the major global gatherings of Spanish-speaking blockchain enthusiasts. To foster the growth and adoption of this technology in the region, BSL brings together business owners, developers, companies, institutions, and regulators from Latin America and around the world. This event aims to create a novel ecosystem of value and trust by supporting and promoting industry-disrupting projects.

First held in May 2018, BSL has gathered more than 50,000 people across all editions. This number is likely to increase considerably in the future, given Latin America’s increasing adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology.
