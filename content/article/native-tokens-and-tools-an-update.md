image_text: Native tokens and tools – an update
---

### One of the features that makes Cardano special is native tokens. Here is an update on its uses and the tools and wallets that have been developed to support it.

The Cardano native tokens feature allows user-defined tokens to be handled by the underlying ledger in the same way as the native ada currency. These user-defined tokens can represent anything from cryptocurrencies to loyalty points or even real-world assets like property or stocks.

Cardano has supported native tokens and multi-asset capability since the Mary hard fork in March 2021. Because the support is built in, no custom code is required to create, transfer or delete tokens. Moreover, because a single Cardano transaction can handle multiple tokens and addresses for a single transaction fee, using and managing native tokens is easier and more cost-effective than dealing with custom tokens on other blockchains.

Native tokens have played a significant role in the growth and development of the Cardano community. Here are some ways native tokens have helped the Cardano community:

*   **Creating new use cases:** Native tokens allow for the creation of new use cases within the Cardano ecosystem. These tokens can be used for anything from creating loyalty programs to facilitating peer-to-peer transactions.
    
*   **Increased adoption:** Native tokens have helped to increase adoption of the Cardano blockchain. The availability of native tokens has attracted more users and developers to the Cardano ecosystem by enabling users to create their own tokens.
    
*   **Tokenization of assets:** Tokenization enables the representation and trading of any digital asset on the Cardano blockchain.
    
*   **DeFi:** Native tokens have facilitated the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Cardano. By enabling the creation of new tokens, Cardano has created a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps) that provide decentralized financial services.  
    

The first native tokens required the use of the Cardano Command Line Interface (Cardano-CLI) to create, transfer and manage them on the Cardano blockchain. Since native tokens have gained in popularity, the Cardano community has risen to the challenge and created a rich variety of tools to extend and enhance the offerings of Input Output Global (IOG).

The following products may be offered by third parties, and IOG makes no representation as to their suitability. The description of each product is based on public information provided by the supplier.
