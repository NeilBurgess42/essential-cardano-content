The Catalyst proposal submission season is the best time to make the point that open systems where anyone with an idea can participate, can be adapted to organizations of different sizes and industries.

In the üèó Open Spaces sessions, we deploy Sociocracy 3.0 mechanisms for submission and approval of proposals from the Gimbalabs community for implementation at Gimbalabs: [https://youtube.com/live/hsJxAM6wmtg?si=NEv8XXXIPOljbJtc&t=997](https://youtube.com/live/hsJxAM6wmtg?si=NEv8XXXIPOljbJtc&t=997)

Exciting times! You know what? Come and share with us that excitement, in the next üèó OS session.
