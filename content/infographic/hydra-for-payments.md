_IOG is collaborating with the Obsidian Systems team to drive the development of use cases based on the Hydra Head protocol. Hydra for Payments is one such use case._

The implementation of Hydra for Payments is one of the showcases of working with a [Hydra Head protocol](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/). The toolkit development is currently in progress with more features to come. To find out more about short-term and long-term goals, read the [Hydra for Payments litepaper](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/10/hydra-for-payments-introducing-developer-tooling-to-unlock-micropayments-on-cardano/).
