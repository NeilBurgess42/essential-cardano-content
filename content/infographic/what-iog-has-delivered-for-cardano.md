The development of the Cardano blockchain is guided by a methodical, research-based, and deliberate approach to innovation. Since Cardanoâ€™s first iteration as a federated network of just seven nodes, Input Output Global Inc. (IOG) has added many new pieces to the blockchain design, one at a time. Over five development phases, IOG introduced innovations, new functionality, and novel features, with each phase building upon the previous phase's achievements.

See the '[What IOG has delivered for Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/what-iog-has-delivered-for-cardano)' paper for a complete overview.
