Welcome to the May edition of Essential Cardano360, your go-to show for the latest updates and insights from the Cardano ecosystem.

In this episode, we’ll have the latest on Voltaire, exploring the advances made toward fostering a culture of self-governance and community empowerment. Community Engagement Lead Sheldon Hunt will join us to give an update on the CIP-1694 community events happening over the next two months. We will also hear from Pi from SundaeSwap about minimal viable governance and his experience with the latest governance workshops.

Plus members of the UTXO alliance Alephium, Ergo Foundation, Nervos Network, Topl & Wolfram Blockchain Labs will share an update on their work advancing collaboration and interoperability for the Cardano network.

This month, we’re also joined by just a few of the many projects Building on Cardano. They’ll be showcasing their contributions to the ecosystem, from Cexplorer, network analytics dashboards to project-based learning with Gimbalabs and a demo from cross-chain DEX BlueShift.
