On its fifth anniversary, September 27th, 2022, Input Output Global CEO, Charles Hoskinson wished the community a fond happy birthday to the Cardano blockchain. Along with some friends from the Cardano community.

While it has been a long and eventful journey for Cardano, this is only the beginning. Vasil represents an incredible evolution and a taste of things to come. But, it's important to remember where Cardano was born:

The Cardano blockchain was launched with the goal of creating a financial and social operating system for the world. This mission grew from foundational academic research into a global decentralized network that brings together builders and changemakers from around the world.

Happy birthday to the Cardano blockchain, and thank you to our international community of ada holders, stake pool operators, developers & creators, entrepreneurs, and supporters.
