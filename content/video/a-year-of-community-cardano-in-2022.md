2022 was a remarkable year for the Cardano ecosystem. From Austin and Denver to Stanford and Edinburgh, the Cardano community rallied together to build and collaborate from around the world, ensuring the continued growth and success of one of the largest blockchain ecosystems. In this video, the team here at Input Output wanted to celebrate what we as a community have accomplished this year - as we prepare for more to come as we usher in the age of Voltaire.
