Every month, Cardano360 brings you the latest news and feature content from across the Cardano ecosystem.

It’s the beginning of a new year and the team at IOG has been working behind the scenes on a number of exciting projects. With more to share in the coming weeks, we’re kicking off our first show of 2023 with a number of updates from the projects building out this incredible ecosystem. We’re joined by EMURGO to talk about the launch of their USDA stablecoin slated for this year, and Marvin Bertin, CSO and co-founder of Genius Yield, and COO of Paribus Wilson Davis stop by for an update.

And we’ve taken a closer look at the Edinburgh Decentralization Index announced at our IO ScotFest event late last year. Professor Aggelos Kiayias and some of the team share more on some of the key innovations this critical research initiative intends to bring to the wider blockchain industry. We’ve also shared a short clip from a long-form conversation between Charles Hoskinson and Aggelos where they touch on some of the key moments from the last six years of IOG’s research, and the importance of first principles when building for the future.
