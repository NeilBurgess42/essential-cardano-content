Consensus continues to be one of the largest and most sought after events in our industry, bringing together thousands of the brightest and boldest influencers from around the world to celebrate the innovations happening across crypto, blockchain, Web3, and the metaverse.

This year, Cardano will be there!

We want to showcase our growth story to Consensus’ 15,000 attendees… and to the world. In addition to the Consensus show floor itself June 9th – June 12th, the Cardano Foundation and IO plan to start with an exclusive Cardano Community evening ahead of the main event.

Hosted at the famous Palmer Center.
