To us, one of the most exciting things about Project Catalyst - and more generally, about the Web3 ecosystem at large - is that we are always encountering new ways of üê£collaborating with other people and other organizations.

**Andamio** is a platform that supports trust-building among groups of people in short periods of time, via Cardano transactions that unlock collaboration, contribution, and reputation building. On-chain. In real time.
