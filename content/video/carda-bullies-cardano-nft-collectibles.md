CardaBullies is a collection of 5,555 algorithmically generated NFTs made from 160 traits. Some traits are humorous or quirky while some are influenced by pop culture, but all are very detailed and crafted with care. All artwork are digitally hand-drawn and are of high quality.

They will be based on the Cardano blockchain due to its security and low transaction fees.
