World is building a mesh network using hybrid spectrum, renewable energy, and blockchain technology. EarthNodes are the backbone of their network and process all transactions on their blockchain.

As an EarthNode operator, youâ€™ll secure their network and earn WMT as per the tokenomics model. Since their network is based on the sharing economy, as the network grows so do your rewards.
