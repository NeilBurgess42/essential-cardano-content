Mass onboarding of organizations outside the ecosystem (["What about Danone?" @YoramBenzvi](https://x.com/YoramBenzvi/status/1810041462114955279)) requires the development of a üèóÔ∏èspecialized infrastructure that leads to high-performing relationships of Learning, Collaboration, and Contribution. [Andamio platform](https://x.com/AndamioPlatform) is a step ahead in this area, but the work continues.

With your support to our Catalyst F12 proposals, we will continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to drive #Cardano to be the epicenter of a global network of Contributors and Collaborators from all kinds of distributed organizations around the world:

‚úÖ[Andamio Purpose Sidechain / Layer 2 Concept](https://www.lidonation.com/sw/proposals/andamio-purpose-sidechain-layer-2-concept-f12):

Lower the barrier to entry to Cardano by allowing people to participate in the Cardano network and the Andamio network without a wallet or ADA.

‚úÖ[Enabling Advanced Contribution and Skills Tracking via APIs](https://www.lidonation.com/sw/proposals/enabling-advanced-contribution-and-skills-tracking-via-apis-f12):

To enhance the Andamio API enabling other applications in the Cardano ecosystem to issue tokens that allow tracking skills and contributions directly on the Cardano blockchain. This approach not only streamlines the verification process but also integrates seamlessly with existing systems, promoting wider adoption and utility.

‚úÖ[Skills and contribution infrastructure on Cardano](https://www.lidonation.com/sw/proposals/skills-and-contribution-infrastructure-on-cardano-f12):

To support organizations and ecosystems in achieving growth by reducing the time and costs associated with onboarding collaborators, preventing falsification of credentials, eliminating bias in the recruitment process, and ensuring recognition of individuals' skills and contributions.

‚úÖ[Adapting On-Chain Reputation to Catalyst Voices](https://www.lidonation.com/sw/proposals/adapting-on-chain-reputation-to-catalyst-voices-f12):

Our proposal will put our role-based skill-building, reputation-building, collaboration, and contribution infrastructure at the service of the Catalyst Voices project and the Catalyst community.

‚úÖ[Developing a Self Sovereign On-chain Identity (SSOI)](https://www.lidonation.com/sw/proposals/developing-a-self-sovereign-on-chain-identity-ssoi-f12):

This initiative aims to develop a new approach to the traditional centralized SSI databases with a blockchain-native framework that not only ensures each identity's uniqueness and security but also allows users comprehensive control over their personal data visibility. The proposed system will leverage Andamio's existing infrastructure to implement a universally applicable SSOI schema, enhancing user trust and ensuring broad compatibility across various platforms within the Cardano network.
