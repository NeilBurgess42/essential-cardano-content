It’s the middle of the month so it’s time for our regular technical update on the latest in Cardano development from Tim Harrison and the IOG team. Joining Tim are regulars John Woods and Kevin Hammond. In this mid-month edition, we’ll have a special chapter diving into Plutus by John Woods. We’ll also have a brief update from just a few of the 850+ projects now building on Cardano.

**NOTE:** Inclusion in this show is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be treated as financial advice or as a direct endorsement of any individual project building on Cardano. Always do your own research.
