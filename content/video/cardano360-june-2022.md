Every month, Cardano360 brings you the latest news and feature content from across the Cardano ecosystem.

In our June edition, we take a look back at some of the key news and the best moments from Consensus2022, including IOG’s new Web3 lightwallet, Lace, and the EVM sidechains initiative. And get to hear from some of the Cardano community who were at Consensus in force to make it such a special event.

We’ll also share some highlights from our audit and certification workshop in Barcelona at the end of May, where IOG got together with projects building on Cardano to talk about best practices and learn more together about this important topic.

Plus, we’ll have the latest on the progress towards the Vasil upgrade and meet just a few of the people making it all happen - from architects, to test engineers to DApp developers.
