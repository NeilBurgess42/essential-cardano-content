Welcome to another episode of Cardano360, your essential guide to the latest news from across the ecosystem. In that spirit, we’ve rebranded the show to become an arm of Essential Cardano, a channel for promoting community-generated content, while championing the innovators scaling the ecosystem for continued adoption.

In our February edition of Essential Cardano360, we’re delighted to bring you the latest content, enriched with insights and updates from various team members and ecosystem guests.

In this edition, we invite you to learn more about the recent Valentine upgrade and its implications for developers building on Cardano, as well as the latest on Voltaire, and its core pillars.

The Catalyst team stops by with an exclusive look into the highly anticipated upcoming Fund10 and a Special Voting Event. We’ll also hear from Alex, IO Product Manager, for a progress update on Lace.

As always, we will keep you informed on the latest developments in the space, as we take a closer look at some of the projects #BuildingonCardano. Join Matthew & Anita from the community team as they interview MELD, DCSpark, and ImperatorLang to gain a deeper understanding of their impressive contributions to the Cardano ecosystem.
