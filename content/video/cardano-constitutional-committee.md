In this video, Michael Madoff, Group Product Manager for Governance at IOG explains Cardanoâ€™s governance system and in particular the role of the Constitutional Committee.

Decentralized governance and decision-making are crucial to ensuring that everyone has a voice and control over the Cardano protocol's future development. The Cardano governance model reflects this by demonstrating the achievability of liquid and representative democracy through individual participation and immutable vote recording. ADA holders can decide on treasury fund distribution and the platform's future development. So, as a community, how can we work together to outline policies and guidelines for the future development of Cardano and ensure that everyone has a say?

Cardano governance has a clear roadmap to bring the Cardano community through this whole process. The Cardano Constitution defines the policies and rules to enable sustainable growth of Cardano's ecosystem to ensure fair participation, protection, and a foundation to meet current and future demands.

Understand the role of the Constitutional Committee, the stages involved, how the constitution will be ratified, Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694, on-chain governance features, expansion of governance capabilities, the roles of DReps and ADA holders, and more.
