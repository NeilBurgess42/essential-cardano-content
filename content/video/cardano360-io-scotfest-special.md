Every month, Cardano360 brings you the latest news and feature content from across the Cardano ecosystem.

In this special edition, we take a look back at some of the key news and the best moments from our 2-day digital event IOG ScotFest, The Age of Voltaire.

We'll revisit Charles Hoskinson's keynote and introduce you to some of the IOG team members, including professor Aggelos Kiayias, IOGâ€™s Chief Scientist, who announced the new IOG Research Hub at the University of Edinburgh. We'll also hear about Midnight, Voltaire & the MBO, and much more.
