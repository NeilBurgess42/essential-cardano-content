🍂 The updates are blowing in just as the leaves are changing this fall season! Welcome to Essential Cardano360 October edition!

🔍 This month we’re celebrating a handful of the community events that have taken place around the world, including multiple summit events and Charles’ keynote address in Argentina, ‘After Voltaire: the next evolution of Cardano.’ Intersect also joins us with an update on governance, including the budget process and the open source committee’s recent work.

And of course, what would be Essential Cardano360 without hearing from you, the community? This month we’ll have Farid from DappCentral on the show with his highlights of the month, plus @SociousDAO, NMKR, and Ikigai join us for Building on Cardano.
