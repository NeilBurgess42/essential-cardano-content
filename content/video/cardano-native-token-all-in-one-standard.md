The initial design choices have created advantages for Cardano native tokens over tokens on other blockchain platforms, here specifically compared to tokens on ETH.

*   First, it demonstrates the lightweight for each token created.
    
*   Second, it brings a low execution fee. As the Cardano token is native, users do not need to pay any fees to transfer tokens.
    
*   Third, it provides safety for Cardano's native tokens as they are managed by the ledger mechanism and have the same level of security as ADA.
    

All of the issues mentioned above will provide flexibility, simplicity, ease of use, and versatility for Cardano's native token. What do you think about these advantages?
