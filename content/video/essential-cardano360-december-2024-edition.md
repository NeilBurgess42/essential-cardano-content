🎉✨ Welcome to the festive December edition of Essential Cardano360!

As 2024 comes to an end, it’s the perfect time to look back on a year filled with progress and growth across the Cardano ecosystem. Together, this community has achieved so much, and we’re here to reflect on just a few of the highlights. 🌠✨

🌟In this special episode, we’ll revisit key moments from 2024, including updates on Mithril, Marlowe, Ouroboros Leios, and RealFi. We’ll also look back at milestones like the Constitutional Convention, progress from Intersect and Project Catalyst, and memorable events such as Rare Evo, QSig, and gatherings in Japan and Argentina.

💬 So grab your favorite drink 🥂, take a seat, and join us as we celebrate the accomplishments of the past 12 months while looking ahead to an exciting 2025.

🎁 Wishing you a wonderful holiday season and a bright new year from all of us at Input | Output! 🎄🧑‍🎄
