When it comes to delegating ADA and choosing a stake pool, it can feel a bit overwhelming at times. The Cardano stake pool ecosystem is coming alive, with a host of great stake pools to choose from.

So where to delegate - and what should you base your choice on?

You should always do your own research so you can make an informed choice and this isn’t financial advice. But this video might help make your options a little clearer.

In this video, we start by looking at how the rewards mechanism works on Cardano, and then go on to talk about how you can delegate your ADA in the interests of the network and your own.

It’s early days and as much as the core protocols and parameters will take us to where we need to be, your choice will determine how fast and how smoothly we get to where we all want to be.
