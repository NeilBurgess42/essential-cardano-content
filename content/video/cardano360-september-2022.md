Welcome to the September edition of Cardano360, your monthly roundup of the freshest news & content from across the ecosystem.

On the heels of the successful Vasil upgrade, we’re diving into some of the key takeaways in our development update, along with hearing firsthand from Genius Yield and Dquadrant how they’re using the latest features. And in the spirit of highlighting the technical vision and capabilities of Cardano, we feature segments featuring our research and education teams, including a recap of our $4.5M collaboration with Stanford University for a new research hub and how to get involved in our Haskell Bootcamp.

We’re also joined by David Taylor from the Cardano Foundation to share more about the Cardano Summit and Ben O’Hanlon, IOG’s Head of Community, sits down with Marco and Peyton to talk about CNFTcon and RareBloom.
