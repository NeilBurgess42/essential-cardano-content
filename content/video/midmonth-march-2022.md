It’s the middle of the month so it's time for our regular short technical update on the latest in Cardano development from Tim Harrison and the IOG team. Joining Tim are regulars John Woods, Kevin Hammond, and Nigel Hemsley plus Jack Rousian to talk UTXO storage. We’ll also have a brief update from just a few of the 500+ projects now [#BuildingOnCardano](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/buildingoncardano).
