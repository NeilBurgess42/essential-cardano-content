By harnessing the power of technology, OpenLitterMap is creating open source tools that empower anyone to map, quantify and communicate their impact. By doing the work, users earn Littercoin which can only be spent in the climate economy.

UK: 62% of people admit dropping street litter. 

US: 90% of residents agree litter is a problem.

Open litter map gamifies collecting litter off streets and into $ADA rewards! An eco #PokemonGo?
