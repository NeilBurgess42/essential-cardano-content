 Adalantis is an underwater digital city inspired by the myth of Lost Atlantis. Our goal is to create a digital world full of possibilities where citizens can enjoy its unique elements and special attributes. We think of Adalantis as a part of the “bigger metaverse” and our vision is to integrate with other projects οn the Cardano blockchain. Through valuable partnerships and constant work, we aim to keep evolving and grow this world together with our dedicated community.
