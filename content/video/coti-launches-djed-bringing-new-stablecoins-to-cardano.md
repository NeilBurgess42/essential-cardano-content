The Cardano ecosystem has seen a significant step up this week, with the launch of Djed, COTI’s native overcollateralized stablecoin.

Tim Harrison spoke to Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI Group to hear more. And some of Djed’s launch partners (SundaeSwap, Wingriders, MuesliSwap and Bitrue) dropped by to say a few words.
