As we dive into the summer season and gear up for numerous in-person events, we‚Äôre taking a fresh approach to our Cardano360 updates. Over the coming weeks, we'll roll out standalone videos featuring special 'BuildingOnCardano' segments and in-depth thought leadership pieces from various IOG teams, including Research & Development.

In this special edition, Kriss Baird and Daniel Ribar reveal the latest from Fund12. Get insights into the new and improved operational components and learn about the RareEvo event in August where you can meet the Catalyst team in person!
