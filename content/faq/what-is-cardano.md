Cardano is an open-source, proof-of-stake, public blockchain, the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and development through evidence-based methods. Cardano combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies. Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.
