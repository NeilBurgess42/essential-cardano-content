Time on Cardano is divided into epochs. Each epoch is divided into slots – a short period of time in which a block can be created. Blocks carry information about recent transactions and their data, and are linked to the previous and next block creating an immutable chain of records. A Cardano epoch includes 432,000 slots (5 days).
