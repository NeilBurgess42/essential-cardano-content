Daedalus is a full-node wallet for desktop or laptop computers. It downloads and synchronizes the entire Cardano blockchain, which takes more time and requires significant storage space. Yoroi is a light-node wallet, which means that it gets data from the source with full blockchain access. This eliminates the need to download the full blockchain history, which makes a light wallet faster and easier to use.
