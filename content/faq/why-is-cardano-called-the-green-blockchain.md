People say [Cardano is ‘green’](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/) because it is a proof-of-stake blockchain that uses little energy and runs on basic hardware. Proof-of-work blockchains are more energy-intensive and generate large amounts of hardware waste.
