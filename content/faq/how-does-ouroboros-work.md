## How does Ouroboros work?

Ouroboros randomly elects a slot leader from among the **stake pools** to create **a block within a slot**. A slot is the primary unit of time used by the Ouroboros algorithm. The more **stake** a pool controls, the greater the chance it has of being elected as a slot leader to produce a new block. When validating a transaction, a slot leader needs to ensure that the sender has included enough funds to pay for that transaction and must also ensure that the transactionâ€™s parameters are met. If the transaction meets all these requirements, the slot leader will record it as a part of a new block, which will then be added to the chain.
