The Plutus Pioneer program is a scheme to recruit and train developers to write smart contracts in Plutus on Cardano. Recruits are given access to courses about the principles of coding in both Haskell and Plutus. The course is highly interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to Plutus creators and experts. There is also a dedicated community channel to help pioneers connect with each other. [Find out more.](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/)
