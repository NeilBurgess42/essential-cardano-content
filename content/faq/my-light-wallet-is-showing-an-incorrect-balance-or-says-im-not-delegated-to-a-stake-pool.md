Light wallets such as Yoroi, Eternl, Flint, Typhon etc rely on servers run by the developers behind them to keep the blockchain information up to date. If you are noticing incorrect balances in your wallets, your wallet says you are not delegated to a Stake Pool or some other issue it may just be that the servers behind the wallet are having sync issues.  
  
Think of the aforementioned wallets more as wallet interfaces. Your wallet is on the blockchain and Yoroi, Eternl, Flint, Typon etc are just software applications you can use to view and interact with your on-chain wallet.  
  
To view your actual balance, Stake Pool delegation etc you can enter your address, which starts with 'addr1' or your stake key which starts with 'stake1' into cardanoscan.io. The section 'Controlled Stake' will show your whole balance including staking rewards.  
  
To fix your wallet interface issues you could try resyncing. You will find a recync option in the settings of most light wallets. If this doesn't fix your issues and your wallet interface is still showing a different balance to cardanoscan.io then you can use your seed phrase or hardware wallet to set up your wallet in a different wallet interface. You can have your wallet set up in multiple wallet interfaces at the same time, this also enables you to so try them out and see which one is best for your needs.
