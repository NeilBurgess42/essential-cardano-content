Cardano’s decentralized governance model grants all ada holders the ability to decide what changes should be made for the ecosystem to grow and mature. Since individuals in the Cardano ecosystem are most affected by the decisions made about the protocol, it is important for them to understand how those decisions are made and how they are paid for, as well as how to participate in that process. Voltaire is the phase in Cardano's development that deals with decentralized governance and decision-making. It focuses on the Cardano community’s ability to decide on software updates, technical improvements, and project funding. To participate in the decision-making process, all ada holders can suggest a change through the Cardano improvement proposal (CIP) system, or participate in Project Catalyst to vote on what changes should be made.
