A hard fork is a radical change to a blockchain protocol, which commonly results in one or more new protocols. The history of previous transactions is then lost and a new ‘forked’ protocol becomes the main one. [Cardano’s unique hard fork combinator](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/) technology enables smooth protocol upgrades without disruption for users and saves the chain history of all operations.
