Cardano is a fully decentralized blockchain platform. This means that thousands of people’s computers (nodes) cooperate to agree if a transaction is valid. This process is enabled by the proof-of-stake [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-consensus) protocol [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-ouroboros). On Cardano, people can send and receive ada (Cardano’s native currency), participate in [staking and delegation](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-staking-and-delegation-on-cardano) to earn rewards, create multi-purposed assets ([native tokens](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-are-native-tokens)) and [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft). Cardano also has different smart contract languages and ensures increased security guarantees using the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol Ouroboros.
