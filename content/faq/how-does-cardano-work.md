Cardano is a fully decentralized blockchain platform. This means that thousands of people’s computers (nodes) cooperate to agree if a transaction is valid. This process is enabled by the proof-of-stake **consensus** protocol **Ouroboros**. On Cardano, people can send and receive ada (Cardano’s native currency), participate in **staking and delegation** to earn rewards, create multi-purposed assets (**native tokens**) and **non-fungible tokens (NFTs).** Cardano also has different smart contract languages and ensures increased security guarantees using the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol Ouroboros.
