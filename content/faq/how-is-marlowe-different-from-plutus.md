[Marlowe](https://marlowe.iohk.io/) and [Plutus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/plutus) are both languages for writing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. 

Plutus is a general purpose language that can handle any type of logic, and is intended for developers who are familiar with the Haskell functional programming language. 

Marlowe, on the other hand, is a Plutus-based domain-specific language. The Marlowe language is designed to be accessible by both developers and non-developers.
