The [Marlowe Pioneer program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-pioneer-program) trains developers and anyone interested in how to write smart contracts using the Marlowe tools. The program has offered courses on building, simulating, analyzing and running smart contracts using Marlowe. The course has involved weekly videos, exercises, Q&A sessions, and access to the course creators and key experts in the field.Â 

The Marlowe team is currently reassessing the strategy to educate and support Marlowe pioneers. Some pioneers did not complete the program, so the team will be investing in educational courses, programs, and workshops tailored to specific audiences.
