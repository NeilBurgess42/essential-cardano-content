CIP stands for Cardano Improvement Proposal and is a participatory model system that gives decision-making power to the community. A CIP has an expected format: the structure of the proposal is templated to facilitate discussion and review. This enables other community members to jump in and discuss specific proposals, or individual points in a proposal. The proposals and their history are publicly available and maintained on the Cardano Foundation [CIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs).
