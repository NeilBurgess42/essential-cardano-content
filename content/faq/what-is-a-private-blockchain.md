Private blockchains are usually established for a predefined number of users by closed organizations, or specific projects. Such blockchains can solve specific business problems relating to efficiency, security, or speed of transaction processing. Private blockchains are better suited for enterprises that seek to enhance their business processes without sharing information publicly.
