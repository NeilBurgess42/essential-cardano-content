Most ada holders do not have the knowledge or desire to run a pool, so they can delegate their stake to a stake pool. Delegation means letting the pool use the stake of owned ada. The more there is staked in a pool, the higher the rewards (until it reaches [saturation](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-the-saturation-point)).
