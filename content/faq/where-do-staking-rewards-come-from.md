There is a *reward pot*. Each epoch, all transaction fees and 0.3% of the remaining ada reserves are put into this pot.

+ 20% of the pot reserves is sent to the treasury to support development through the Catalyst voting process.

+ 80% is used as staking rewards.

Over time, transaction fees will become the main source of staking rewards.
