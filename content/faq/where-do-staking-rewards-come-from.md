Thereâ€™s a Reward Pot.

Each epoch, all transaction fees and 0.3% of the remaining Ada reserves are put into the Pot.

20% of the Pot is sent to the Treasury to support development through a voting process (Catalyst).

80% is used as staking rewards.

Over time, transaction fees will become the main source of staking rewards.
