'Native tokens' is Cardanoâ€™s feature that enables the creation of multi-purposed assets. Users can create their own tokens that interact with the blockchain just like ada. Tokens can be **fungible** (interchangeable) or **non-fungible** (unique), and act as payment units, rewards, tradable assets, or information holders. There is no need to create smart contracts to handle native tokens, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for errors.
