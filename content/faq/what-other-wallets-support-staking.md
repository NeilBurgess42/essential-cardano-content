## What other wallets support staking?

The best way to stake ada is by using Daedalus or Yoroi wallets. You can choose Exodus, Adalite, Nami, or any other wallet but note that some of them won't let you choose the pool you want. This means that you will be able to delegate your ada only to the pool that supports a certain wallet. Some of these pools can have pretty expensive fees.
