If you're wondering whether you need a hardware wallet the answer is probably yes. If you have an amount of cryptocurrency that you are concerned to lose you should probably get one.  
  
While using a Cardano wallet interface such as Yoroi, Daedalus, Flint, Eternl etc without a hardware wallet the cryptographic keys to your on-chain wallet are stored on your computer or mobile phone. The only thing protecting your wallet keys in this scenario is your spending password and as the device is connected to the Internet this leaves them vulnerable to hacking attempts. A hacker could potentially decrypt your wallet keys and sign a transaction sending all of your funds to themselves.

If you use a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor device in conjunction with one of the wallet interfaces mentioned above the cryptographic keys to your wallet are stored on the hardware wallet itself. In this scenario your cryptographic keys are never exposed to the Internet connected device and physical access to the device is needed to be able to sign a transaction. This makes your cryptocurrency wallet a lot more secure.  
  
Another reason to use a hardware wallet is that you can switch between wallet interfaces to try them out without having to type in your seed phrase. Every time you type your seed phrase into an Internet connected device you are putting your wallet at risk. With a hardware wallet you can just pair it to the new wallet interface and you're good to go.
