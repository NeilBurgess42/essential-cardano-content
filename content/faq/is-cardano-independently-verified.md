## Is Cardano independently verified?

Development on Cardano is driven by peer-reviewed research. This means that before any feature is implemented, it undergoes scientific review and verification by academics. In addition, Quantstamp, a blockchain security specialist, has independently audited Cardano for quality and safety. After the audit, Quantstamp’s chief executive Richard Ma said [Cardano had ‘one of the best code bases we have seen’](https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/quantstamp-cardano-wird-zweitgroesste-defi-plattform-nach-ethereum/).
