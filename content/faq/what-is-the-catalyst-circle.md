The [Catalyst Circle](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle/) is the representative body for groups participating in Project Catalyst. The Circle monitors the current state and future plans regarding governance in Catalyst. It detects and discusses concerns, objections, and opportunities arising within the Catalyst ecosystem. The Circle might discuss, for example, the definition of amounts allocated to challenges Fund over Fund; changes or conditions to incentive parameters; the Catalyst API, etc.
