## Who is a stake pool operator (SPO)?

A stake pool operator is a person or organization that takes responsibility for setting up and keeping a pool running. This usually entails owning or renting a server, holding the key to the pool, and maintaining and monitoring the node. The operator earns rewards for validating transactions on Cardano. These rewards are distributed between the operator and the ada holders who delegated their stake to the pool.
