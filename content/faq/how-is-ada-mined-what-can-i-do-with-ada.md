Mining ada isn't possible because mining is the feature of proof-of-work blockchains. On Cardano, owners can [stake and delegate](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-staking-and-delegation-on-cardano) ada to earn rewards. By delegating their stake, users help run the Cardano blockchain. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days.
