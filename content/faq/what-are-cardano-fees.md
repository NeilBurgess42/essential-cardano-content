A fee is the amount of ada charged for processing a transaction on Cardano. Fees contribute to the network's financial health and development, and prevent economic attacks. [Cardanoâ€™s deterministic nature](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/) ensures that fees are stable, predictable, and low in comparison to such proof-of-work blockchains like Ethereum, for example.
