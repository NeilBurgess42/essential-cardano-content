It is highly **not** recommended to store ada or any cryptocurrency on exchanges, as this increases the risk of funds loss. [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) are official Cardano wallets that are safe and secure for storing ada. They also provide users with a possibility to delegate ada to stake pools and earn passive rewards. Many other wallets also support ada.
