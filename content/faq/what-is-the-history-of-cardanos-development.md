## Whatâ€™s the history of Cardano's development?

Cardano was launched in 2017 to address problems with earlier blockchains such as high energy use, limited interoperability, and scalability. Cardano is being developed in five phases: **Byron** (completed 2019), **Shelley** (decentralization, 2020), **Goguen** (smart contracts, 2021-), **Basho** (performance improvements, 2021-), **Voltaire** (treasury and governance, 2021-).
