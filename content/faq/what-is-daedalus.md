## What is Daedalus?

[Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) is one of Cardano's official wallets, along with [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/). Developed by IOG, Daedalus is the open-source desktop software wallet of choice for storing ada. It's a full-node wallet, which means the full Cardano blockchain needs to be downloaded, and each transaction is verified for maximum user security.
