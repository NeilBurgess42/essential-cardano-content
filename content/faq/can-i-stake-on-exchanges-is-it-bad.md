Staking on exchanges means that ada is kept on exchanges, which incurs security risks. Given that exchanges own a large amount of ada, this also poses a centralization issue. It is important for Cardano to maintain a healthy distribution of stake across many pool operators. The best way is to choose a stake pool that best meets the goals and values that a person supports and shares. You can discover multiple pools and their websites in Daedalus or use sources such as [](adapools.org)[adapools.org](https://adapools.org/), for example, to choose the pool for delegation.
