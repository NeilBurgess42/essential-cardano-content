This is a common question from people who are new to Cardano, people who are familiar with staking on other blockchains or from people who are moving their funds from an exchange to a self-custodial wallet such as Daedalus, Eternl, Flint, Typhon, Yoroi etc.

As Cardano is a Proof of Stake blockchain, it relies on people (delegators) delegating their ada to Stake Pools to secure the blockchain and in return they are rewarded with ada, this is known as staking. As Cardano relies on delegators taking part in this process it has been designed to be very secure.

*   When a delegator stakes their ada on Cardano their funds do not leave their wallet, therefore the staking mechanism does not put the delegator's ada at risk.
    
*   Staking is liquid, which means ada is also not locked up for any period, delegators can move or spend their ada whenever they like.
    
*   The worst thing that could happen is that a Stake Pool could underperform, in which case a delegator may not receive all of the staking rewards that they were expecting. Even if this happens, the ada in the delegator's wallet is not at risk of being slashed or penalised in any way.
    
*   In line with the ethos of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, staking is completely trustless and staking rewards are distributed automatically by the protocol.
    
*   A delegator can move to a new Stake Pool any time they wish.
    
*   You can stake while using a hardware wallet and it is advisable to use one for extra security. See '[Should I get a hardware wallet?](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/should-i-get-a-hardware-wallet)'
    

You could think of staking your ada as a vote of confidence in a Stake Pool. Each ada you have in the wallet that you have delegated to a Stake Pool increases the chances of that Stake Pool being chosen to produce the next block.
