## When will I receive my rewards?

Rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch (every five days). If this is the first time you delegated your funds to a pool, the process will take longer. If you delegate your ada during the first epoch, the pool that you delegate to can produce blocks two epochs later. Two epochs after that, you will begin receiving rewards. In this case, you will begin receiving staking rewards after 20 days.
