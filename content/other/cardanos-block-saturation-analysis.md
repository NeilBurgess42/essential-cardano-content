Despite market conditions, Cardano usage is growing.

Please note the increased efficiency of transactions - i.e. transactions for one purpose are now smaller than they had to be before. Even so, block saturation is not decreasing, indicating activity on the network.

**Monthly block saturation average is 40.88%. This means that almost half of the blocks cap is used.**
