We are a community of Cardano stake pool operators & developers who prefer using efficient ARM-based computers. We aim to provide support and free educational resources for the Cardano community.

Although our focus is ARM stake pool operations, we provide a wide range of information, tutorials, and resources for developing on the Cardano blockchain.
