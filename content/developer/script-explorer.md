### The Cardano Script Explorer opens for the interested public.

If you want to see the latest and greatest scripts on the Cardano Blockchain, you can now do so from the comforts of your Blockfrost account.

In the context of the Catalyst Fund 9 I was introduced to the Blockfrost, which is an API that provides Blockchain data. That gave me the idea to create a tool, that makes all the awesome scripts on Cardano visible. So I applied for funding in Fund 9, but I was too impatient to wait for the voting results. Thus I built the alpha version of the Script Explorer.

There you can take a look at Timelock and Plutus scripts in detail and Sankey, this is quite insightful for a Smart Contract developer.
