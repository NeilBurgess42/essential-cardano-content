### This is a delegation method that uses CIP-30 to improve the quality of life for developers and delegators

The tool provided below enables any browser-based decentralized application (DApp) to feature a delegation button for any stake pool. It includes batteries via API to fetch only the necessary parameters of the Cardano blockchain, allowing the transaction to be written on the client-side. This provides the user with enhanced trust and security, as they can sign and submit the transaction using their preferred browser wallet. The tool eliminates the need to send a transaction hex back and forth over the internet.

Our code is public and there are no hidden fees or transactions.

Stake pools deserve to have a delegate button on their website.
