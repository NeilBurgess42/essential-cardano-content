### This is a delegation method that uses CIP-30 to improve the quality of life for developers and delegators

The provided below tool allows any browser DApp to have a delegation button for any stake pool. This has batteries included via API to only get the parameters of the Cardano blockchain to write the transaction on the client side, providing the user with trust and security to sign and submit using their choice of the browser wallet. The tool doesn't require sending a transaction hex over the internet back and forth.

Our code is public and there are no hidden fees or transactions.

Stake pools deserve to have a delegate button on their website.
