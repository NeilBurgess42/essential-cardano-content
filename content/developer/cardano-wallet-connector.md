[Cardano Wallet Connector](https://github.com/dynamicstrategies/cardano-wallet-connector) is a quick start and boilerplate code to connect dApps with Web wallets using the latest Cardano-serialization-lib. It includes examples of how to lock ADA and Tokens (NFTs) at a Plutus script address and then how to redeem them from the Plutus script address ... All from the front end. The project is bootstrapped with a Create React App, so it is quick to get started for those familiar with this front-end framework.
