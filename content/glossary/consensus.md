A way for a blockchain to agree between all its participants that a transaction is valid. An agreement must be made on which blocks to produce, which chain to adopt, and to determine a single state for the network. The consensus protocol for Cardano is [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/) â€“ the first consensus protocol proven to be secure through academic peer review.
