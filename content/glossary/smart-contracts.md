Programs that execute on the blockchain when certain pre-determined conditions are met. On Cardano, contracts can be written in many high-level languages like Plinth (Plutus Tx), [Marlowe](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/marlowe), or Aiken, which then get compiled into Plutus Core. Such contracts are the basis of decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/decentralized-finance-defi)).
