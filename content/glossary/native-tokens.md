**Native tokens**: users can create their own [tokens](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/token) on Cardano and these interact with the blockchain just like ada. Tokens can be [fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/fungible-token) (interchangeable) or [non-fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft) (unique), and act as payment units, rewards, trading assets, or information holders. There is no need to create smart contracts to handle native tokens, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for errors.
