**Native tokens**: users can create their own **tokens** on Cardano and these interact with the blockchain just like ada. Tokens can be **fungible** (interchangeable) or **non-fungible** (unique), and act as payment units, rewards, trading assets, or information holders. There is no need to create **smart contracts** to handle native tokens, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for errors.
