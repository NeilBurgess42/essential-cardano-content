FUD stands for "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt"

It's a tactic that is often used in marketing, politics, and other forms of communication to create a sense of fear or apprehension among the audience. FUD can be used to discourage people from taking a certain action. The goal of FUD is to manipulate people's emotions and influence their behavior by making them feel anxious, uncertain, and doubtful about a particular situation or decision.
