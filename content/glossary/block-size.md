Block size refers to the maximum amount of data that can be included in a single block of a blockchain. The block size is typically measured in bytes and serves as an important parameter in blockchain protocols. It determines the maximum number of transactions or the total size of data that can be included in a block.

Currently in Cardano blockchain, the block size is 88kB.
