refers to a Cardano address that is used for receiving ADA from external sources. These external sources can include other users, exchanges, or any entity that wishes to send ADA to your wallet.

External addresses typically do not expire. User can continue to use the same external address to receive ADA for an extended period. However, for privacy reasons, it's a good practice to rotate or generate new addresses periodically.
