**Initial stake pool offering (ISPO)**: a way to raise funds for [DApps](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dapp) or projects on Cardano. A project offers its users tokens usable within its DApp in exchange for these users delegating their stake to the project’s [pool](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool). This increases the pool’s margin and helps it gain more rewards. Users receive staking rewards and benefit by getting utility tokens. There is no risk of losing funds because they don’t leave your wallet when delegating.
