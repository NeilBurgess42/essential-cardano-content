A [token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/token) that is identical to many others and can be traded is fungible. For example, one ada is the same as all others and so is fungible. Shares in a company, gold bars, and US dollars, for example, are all fungible. Cryptos are usually fungible, but there are also unique, [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft).
