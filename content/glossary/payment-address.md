Refers to an address used for receiving or sending ADA. Cardano uses a unique address format that differs from many other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. It consists of two parts: the payment address and the stake address, which involves staking ADA to earn rewards.

These addresses can start with "addr" and are case-insensitive. For example: "_addr1qytdq4cjldj7lruyq5ppm7wzg6z7tk95j8njqay3g60f8rq7k3cvvlkegt9wv8ar4knyl4vkj63w8e5a8rzm6fqsx6hjk4gzvt3"_.
