refers to the fundamental characteristic where once recorded, data stored within blocks remains unchanged and unalterable. This permanence is achieved through [cryptographic](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cryptography) hashing and [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/consensus) mechanisms, ensuring that transactions and information recorded on the blockchain cannot be tampered with or modified retroactively.

Immutable data provides assurance of the integrity and authenticity of transactions, fostering trust and transparency within the Cardano ecosystem.
