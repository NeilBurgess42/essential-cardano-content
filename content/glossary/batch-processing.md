In the context of the Cardano blockchain, batch processing denotes a systematic strategy where numerous transactions are bundled and executed together in a single operation, thereby refining network efficiency and resource allocation. This approach streamlines the validation and implementation of transactions, augmenting overall throughput and scalability by consolidating multiple tasks into cohesive batches.
