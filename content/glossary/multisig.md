Multisig refers to a type of digital signature scheme that requires multiple signatures from different parties in order to authorize a transaction or an action on the blockchain.

Multisig is commonly used as a security measure to protect against unauthorized access and ensure that transactions are only executed with the approval of multiple parties.
