**NFT**: non-fungible token. A unique **token** stored on a blockchain. NFTs can represent digital ownership rights of real-world assets such as a building or a painting or be an asset in and of themselves. Cardano supports NFTs as **native tokens**. This means that anyone can mint their own NFTs on Cardano without needing a smart contract, which avoids the error-prone complexity found in Ethereum, makes them more secure, cheaper, and faster to transact with.
