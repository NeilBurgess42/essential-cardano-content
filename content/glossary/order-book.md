An order book is the method of exchange used in traditional markets and has also been used in [DEX](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dex)s to allow users to transfer assets in a decentralized manner.

Users lock their order up in a smart contract, e.g. to sell A amount X for B amount of Y, and it is posted to the order book. When another users who wants to swap B amount of Y for A amount of X comes along they fulfill that order and the assets are swapped between the user.
