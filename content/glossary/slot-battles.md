Regarding the production of blocks on the Cardano blockchain, there can be instances when two pools create valid blocks in the same slot. Only one block can be added to the blockchain for each specific slot, so one of them has to be discarded (orphaned block).

If a slot battle occurs, the winner is determined randomly. The pool operator has no influence over the selection of the block occurring on other nodes in the network.
