An algorithmic way to provide liquidity between trading pairs on a [DEX](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dex). A trading pair is a match between Alice, who wants to sell her bitcoin, and Bob, who wants to buy it, for example. AMMs are decentralized and depend on the [liquidity provided by their users](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/liquidity-mining).
