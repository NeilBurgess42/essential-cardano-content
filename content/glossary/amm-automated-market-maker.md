An Automated Market Maker, AMM, is an algorithmic way to facilitate swaps on a [DEX](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dex). Some users, called liquidity providers, provide liquidity to different "pools" of assets on a DEX and users who want to swap their tokens do so in these liquidity pools. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees paid by the swappers.
