BaaS, or Blockchain-as-a-Service, refers to a cloud-based service model where third-party providers offer blockchain infrastructure and management tools to users, enabling them to build, deploy, and manage decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain without the need for extensive blockchain expertise or infrastructure setup.
