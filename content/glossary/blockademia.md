A DApp project on Cardano that enables users to verify authenticity of any previously published document or digital file. Blockademia writes a hash of the published document in a Cardano transaction, so the published hash stays on the blockchain and enables users to quickly and easily check if any file is original or if it has been tampered with.

Blockademia uses it's native token ACI for multiple uses, including: operating on the DApp, enabling referal rewards, rewarding stakers, and more.
