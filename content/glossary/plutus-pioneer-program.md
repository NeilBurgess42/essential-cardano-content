[Plutus Pioneer program](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/): a scheme to recruit and train developers to write [Plutus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/plutus) smart contracts on Cardano. Participants gain access to a [set of courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igV7kMXcdpw) about how to code in both [Haskell](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/haskell) and Plutus. The program is interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with access to experts in the language.
