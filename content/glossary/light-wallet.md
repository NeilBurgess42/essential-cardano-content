A cryptocurrency wallet that does not need to download the full history of blockchain records. Instead, the wallet links into a website where the full blockchain is accessed. This makes a light wallet faster and easier to use. Examples include [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) or [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/), for instance.
