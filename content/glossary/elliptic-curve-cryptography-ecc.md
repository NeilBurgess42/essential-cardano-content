ECC is used for developing cryptographic protocols and secure applications. ECC provides the same level of security as other mechanisms while using shorter keys and signatures. Examples of elliptic curves include Standards for Efficient Cryptography ([SECP](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/secp)**)** signatures such as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr.
