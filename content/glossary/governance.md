There is no single decision-maker controlling Cardano's growth and development. Instead, decentralized processes empower ada holders to make suggestions and collaborate on decisions. All ada holders can suggest a change through the Cardano improvement proposal ([CIP](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cip)) system, or participate in [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) to vote on what changes should be made.
