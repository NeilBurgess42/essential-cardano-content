**Cardano**: an open-source permissionless blockchain platform built on the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Cardano was launched in 2017 to address issues with earlier blockchains such as high energy use, limited interoperability, and scalability challenges. Cardano is being developed in five phases: **Byron** (completed 2019), **Shelley** (decentralization, 2020), **Goguen** (smart contracts, 2021-), **Basho** (performance improvements, 2021-), **Voltaire** (treasury and governance, 2021-).
