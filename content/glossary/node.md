One of the computer servers or wallets making up the Cardano network. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain ledger and connects with other participants to help maintain network operations. A [stake pool operator](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator) runs different types of nodes: a block-producing node and several relay nodes that are connected with each other. See [Networking](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking).
