**Slashing**: a penalty charge on some proof-of-stake blockchains for dishonest behavior by network validators. There is no slashing on Cardano. Instead, [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros) provides incentives for good behavior. Each [stake pool operator](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator) pledges funds to their pool to make it more attractive and earn a higher percentage of rewards. Dishonest behavior will result in loss of rewards. Leading-edge game theory techniques have contributed to this strategy.
