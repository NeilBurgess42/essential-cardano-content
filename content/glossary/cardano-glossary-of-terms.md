**Actus**: Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard. A global standard for financial **smart contracts**. These contracts are being implemented in Cardano’s **Marlowe** smart contract language.

**Ada:** Cardano’s native currency is named after Ada Lovelace, the English mathematician and programmer. Holders can use ada as a digital currency to pay transaction **fees**. By delegating their **stake** in ada, users can help run the Cardano blockchain. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days.

**Asset:** an item on the blockchain that has a value, such as **ada** or a **token**.

**Babel fees:** a mechanism that will enable transaction **fees** to be paid in coins other than ada on Cardano. This ensures improved **interoperability** and ease of use.

**Basho**: Cardano development phase that focuses on **scalability** and performance improvements.

**Block**: a set of validated transactions on the network. Blocks contain cryptographic information from previous blocks, and also new transaction data.

**Block time**: the average time between blocks. In early 2022, Ethereum’s block time was  12-14 seconds, Cardano’s 20 seconds, and Bitcoin’s 10 minutes.

**Byron**: the first phase of Cardano development focused on implementing the core transactional platform and community growth. Byron implemented the **Ouroboros** proof-of-stake consensus protocol.

**Cardano**: an open-source permissionless blockchain platform built on the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Cardano was launched in 2017 to address issues with earlier blockchains such as high energy use, limited interoperability, and scalability challenges. Cardano is being developed in five phases: **Byron** (completed 2019), **Shelley** (decentralization, 2020), **Goguen** (smart contracts, 2021-), **Basho** (performance improvements, 2021-), **Voltaire** (treasury and governance, 2021-).

**Cardano Foundation**: an independent, Swiss-based non-profit organization that supervises the development of the Cardano blockchain, while shaping legislation and commercial standards. Its mission is to ‘ensure the positive advancement of the Cardano protocol, while also contributing to the positive advancement of blockchain as a world-changing technology.’ Cardano Foundation is one of the three founding organizations of Cardano. The other two are **IOG** and **Emurgo**. 

**Cardano stack exchange**: a community-driven resource providing [questions and answers](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) for users and developers of Cardano.

**Certification**: a high level of assurance is key when developing and working with **smart contracts** and decentralized applications (**DApps**). Applications in Cardano’s **dAppStore** will have the option to meet and display up to three [levels of certification](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/25/new-certification-levels-for-smart-contracts-on-cardano/).

**cFund**: an early-stage investment fund focused on innovative companies primarily using the Cardano blockchain and its technology. The [cFund](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/28/a-closer-look-at-the-cfund/) is managed by Wave Financial and **IOG**.

**CIP**: Cardano improvement proposal. Any ada holder can suggest an improvement to Cardano. CIPs are community-reviewed; proposals and their history are maintained on the **Cardano Foundation**’s [CIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs). 

**Cold wallet**: an offline wallet used for storing cryptocurrencies. Because cold wallets are not connected to the internet, stored assets incur less risks of tampering. This is also known as _cold storage_.

**Concurrency**: the amount of work that can be done by [different actors without blocking each other](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/). Cardano’s **EUTXO** model allows transactions to be processed in parallel, which ultimately improves the throughput of the system while keeping the performance of individual operations the same.

**Consensus**: a way for a blockchain to agree between all its participants that a transaction is valid. An agreement must be made on which blocks to produce, which chain to adopt, and to determine a single state for the network. The consensus protocol for Cardano is [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/) – the first consensus protocol proven to be secure through academic peer review.

**Cryptocurrency**: an asset on the blockchain that serves as a medium of exchange for goods or services. At its launch, Cardano became the leading proof-of-stake cryptocurrency and one of the top 10 by market capitalization in [January 2018](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20180107/). In 2022, it is one of only four coins still in that top 10.

**Daedalus**: a secure wallet for the **ada** cryptocurrency that manages balances and enables sending and receiving payments. [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) is a full node wallet, which means that it downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. 

**DApp**: a digital application that runs on the blockchain. Just like a mobile app runs on your iOS or Android device, a Cardano DApp runs on the Cardano blockchain. There are various categories of DApps, such as **DeFi** products, **NFT** markets, wallets, exchanges, games, and more.

**dAppStore**: a website where users will be able to download both certified and uncertified applications that run on the Cardano blockchain. See also [Certification](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/25/new-certification-levels-for-smart-contracts-on-cardano/).

**Decentralization**: the property of a system that provides independence from a central governing authority. Cardano is supported by more than 3,000 **stake pool operators** across the globe who help validate network activities. **Peer-to-peer** connections and fair **governance** using [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) and **Voltaire** all contribute to Cardano’s decentralization mission. 

**Decentralized finance (DeFi)**: a blockchain-based form of finance that removes the need for intermediaries such as banks, and uses **smart contracts** to settle deals between parties. 

**Decentralized identifier (DID)**: a unique identifier that is not issued or controlled by a central authority. The controller of the DID (in the case of a person, the object of the DID) can prove ownership without requiring permission from any other party.

**Decentralized identity**: a system in which users retain control over their identity using a blockchain wallet. This technology ensures data is stored securely and protects privacy rights. Users choose when and with whom they share their identity and credentials, which the requester verifies on the blockchain.

**Delegation**: the process whereby ada owners can assign their funds using their wallets to a **stake pool**. This helps maintain a computer server to run a node on the Cardano **network**. In exchange, delegators receive a share of the pool’s total rewards. Delegating your ada is totally safe because no **ada** leaves the user’s wallet.

**Determinism**: [the predictability of costs](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/) for a blockchain transaction. Cardano uses deterministic pricing, which means you know how much a transaction will cost before you make it. Protocol parameters, rather than network traffic, govern pricing on Cardano, so prices remain stable and low. No fees are charged for failed transactions, which differentiates Cardano from indeterministic chains like Ethereum.

**DEX**: decentralized exchange. A type of crypto exchange with no intermediary, where users can securely trade their assets directly with other users. 

**Djed**: a Cardano **stablecoin** announced in 2021 and issued by [COTI](https://coti.io/) – a crypto payments platform provider.

**Emurgo**: a global blockchain solutions provider that focuses on the promotion of Cardano-based commercial applications. [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) is one of the three founding organizations of Cardano. The other two are **IOG** and the **Cardano Foundation**.  

**Epoch**: a unit of time on Cardano. An epoch lasts for 120 hours, equivalent to 432,000 **slots**.

**ERC20 converter**: a tool that allows ERC20 tokens to be used on Cardano. Users benefit from a higher capacity of transaction processing, lower fees, and the greater security offered by the **Ouroboros** consensus protocol. [SingularityNET’s](https://singularitynet.io/) Agix token is the first token that users can move between Ethereum and Cardano.

**EUTXO**: the accounting model used by Cardano. This is an extended version of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output model. EUTXO brings greater security, ensures fees are predictable, and can process a large number of transactions in parallel. ​​It also supports different types of **assets** and **smart contracts**, without compromising the advantages of **UTXO**. 

**Faucet**: a web-based service that provides free **tokens** for **testnets**.

**Fee**: the amount of ada charged for processing a transaction on Cardano.

**Fiat currency**: a medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes issued by central banks. The US dollar, British pound, and Japanese yen are all fiat money. 

**Finality (transaction finality)**: the point in time when the result of a transaction becomes immutable and true for everyone on the blockchain.

**Formal verification**: the process of checking whether system design and the underlying algorithms are correct and satisfy the given requirements and properties. It is based on the formal methods of mathematics and is an integral part of **IOG** research. The core parts of Cardano are written in **Haskell**.

**Fungible token**: a **token** that is identical to many others and can be traded is fungible. For example, one ada is the same as all others and so is fungible. Shares in a company, gold bars, and US dollars, for example, are all fungible. Cryptos are usually fungible, but there are also unique, **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs).

**Game theory**: the study of logical decision-making made by players within the defined parameters of a system. Game theory provides mathematical frameworks for predicting interactions between people in a system, where they are all looking out for their best interests. Cardano uses game theory to help avoid economic attacks on the network. 

**Goguen**: the third phase of Cardano development that brought **smart contract** support.

**Governance**: there is no single decision-maker controlling Cardano's growth and development. Instead, decentralized processes empower ada holders to make suggestions and collaborate on decisions. All ada holders can suggest a change through the Cardano improvement proposal (**CIP**) system, or participate in [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) to vote on what changes should be made.

**Hard fork**: an irreversible change to a blockchain protocol. Cardano uses a [hard fork combinator](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/) to ensure smooth upgrades. Unlike earlier blockchains, Cardano hard forks save the chain history and do not cause disruption for users.

**Hardware wallet:** a device that stores cryptocurrencies offline and can be connected to a computer to access the funds. Hardware wallets are secure and beneficial in terms of offline security and convenience as they can be carried around and used when needed.

**Haskell**: a functional programming language with a focus on producing secure code.  Haskell is well suited to Cardano's high-assurance code, and the need for greater formal verification in the blockchain. Core parts of Cardano are written in Haskell and extensive testing processes ensure **Plutus** Core smart contracts work properly. 

**Hot wallet**: a cryptocurrency wallet that can be accessed _online_ to store currencies and make transactions. A hot wallet stores a collection of private keys and needs to be connected to the internet to process cryptocurrency operations. 

**Hydra**: a [family of protocols](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/17/hydra-cardano-s-solution-for-ultimate-scalability/) that overlay the **layer 1** Cardano blockchain to process transactions off the main chain. Hydra uses the main ledger as the secure settlement layer, boosts throughput, minimizes the delay in starting to process transactions, incurs low to no costs, and greatly reduces storage requirements.

**Hydra Head**: the first of several Hydra protocols, and the basis of improving Cardano's **scalability**. Each [Hydra Head](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/03/implementing-hydra-heads-the-first-step-towards-the-full-hydra-vision/) works as an off-chain mini ledger, similar but faster than the main on-chain ledger, shared between small groups of participants. Many complex protocols can be added as layers on top of Cardano.

**Initial stake pool offering (ISPO)**: a way to raise funds for **DApps** or projects on Cardano. A project offers its users tokens usable within its DApp in exchange for these users delegating their stake to the project’s **pool**. This increases the pool’s margin and helps it gain more rewards. Users receive staking rewards and benefit by getting utility tokens. There is no risk of losing funds because they don’t leave your wallet when delegating.

**Interoperability**: aims to enable interconnection between blockchains. Cross-chain transfers and the ‘internet of blockchains’ will grant enhanced user experience and functionality. **Sidechains** and the AGIX **ERC20 converter** support Cardano's interoperability.

**IOG**: Input Output Global. The new name for IOHK, the company that developed the Cardano blockchain. IOG was registered in the US state of Wyoming in 2018, along with an office in Singapore.

**IOHK**: Input Output Hong Kong was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood to create Cardano. The company became Input Output Global in 2018.

**KEVM**: [K Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/virtual-machines/kevm/overview/). It allows developers to experiment with any smart contract that can be run on the EVM, and offers improved security and performance.

**Layer 1:** the main blockchain ledger that operates on the underlying consensus protocol. This layer includes protocol parameters that control capabilities such as **scalability** and throughput. 

**Layer 2:** an additional, off-chain protocol that works on top of the layer 1 blockchain. Parties can securely transfer funds from the blockchain into an off-chain protocol, settle transactions in this protocol independently of the underlying chain, and safely transfer funds back to the underlying chain as needed. Layer 2 protocols improve overall throughput and scalability because they reduce network congestion.

**Ledger:** a database of blockchain records. On Cardano, more than 3,000 stake pools distributed worldwide operate and maintain this ledger. 

**Light wallet:** a cryptocurrency wallet that does not need to download the full history of blockchain records. Instead, the wallet links into a website where the full blockchain is accessed. This makes a light wallet faster and easier to use. Examples include [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) or [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/), for instance. 

**Liquid democracy:** Cardano’s **delegation** mechanism is based on a liquid democracy, meaning that staked funds are never locked and can be spent at any time. Other platforms use a third-party protocol to make staked tokens liquid, which has the potential to introduce security problems.

**Lovelace**: the sub unit for ada. One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces. The name comes from Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron who became a mathematician and programmer with her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine project.

**Mainnet:** the live blockchain. Cardano upgrades are assessed on a testnet before being released on the mainnet. 

**Market capitalization**: a measure used by crypto exchanges to rank coins. The ‘market cap’ is calculated by multiplying the number of coins in circulation by the coin price on the day.

**Marlowe**: a web-based platform to build and run financial smart contracts visually, without needing deep programming knowledge. [Marlowe](https://marlowe-finance.io/) contracts are straightforward and optimized for financial transactions. This provides a faster way for financial service providers to build expertise in smart contracts and blockchain technology.

**Marlowe Playground**: a browser-based tool for writing and testing financial smart contracts. Its purpose is to encourage developers who have no **Haskell** or Javascript experience to build financial products on Cardano. 

**Metadata**: information about a digital file. In **smart contracts**, metadata sets out the conditions under which a deal should execute. In a non-fungible token, metadata can hold information about the ownership or intellectual rights, among other things.

**Mithril**: the Cardano upgrade to streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications. Mithril retains strong security settings and its uses include secure voting, data exchange between sidechains, and data synchronization within light wallets. It is part of the **Basho** phase and will be implemented in 2022.

**Multi-asset**: Cardano can support more than one **asset** type, including user-defined **tokens**.

**Native tokens**: users can create their own **tokens** on Cardano and these interact with the blockchain just like ada. Tokens can be **fungible** (interchangeable) or **non-fungible** (unique), and act as payment units, rewards, trading assets, or information holders. There is no need to create **smart contracts** to handle native tokens, which removes a layer of added complexity and potential for errors.

**Networking**: a technical infrastructure linking Cardano **nodes** in one unified system to process transactions. **Stake pool operators** run Cardano **nodes** that communicate with other nodes to share information about new blocks and transactions. This includes three processes: each operator runs a block-producing node (the node that verifies and creates a block) and two relay nodes (which don’t produce blocks but share information). Wallets and exchanges operate as nodes too. They can help verify blockchain activities by running a block-producing node, which is connected to other relays. 

**NFT**: non-fungible token. A unique **token** stored on a blockchain. NFTs can represent digital ownership rights of real-world assets such as a building or a painting or be an asset in and of themselves. Cardano supports NFTs as **native tokens**. This means that anyone can mint their own NFTs on Cardano without needing a smart contract, which avoids the error-prone complexity found in Ethereum, makes them more secure, cheaper, and faster to transact with.

**Node**: one of the computer servers or wallets making up the Cardano network. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain ledger and connects with other participants to help maintain network operations. A **stake pool operator** runs different types of nodes: a block-producing node and several relay nodes that are connected with each other. See **networking**.

**Oracle**: a service to transfer information from the real world to **smart contracts**. The oracle fetches and authenticates live data such as exchange rates and weather conditions to provide this data for smart contracts. 

**Ouroboros**: the consensus protocol for Cardano. Ouroboros ensures that all participants agree on valid transactions. It is the first consensus protocol proven to be secure through academic peer review. The name comes from an ancient symbol that represents eternity and symbolizes the theoretical eternity of a blockchain. There have been several versions of Ouroboros: **Classic** (Byron phase, 2017), **BFT** (Byron/Shelley phases, 2020), **Praos** (Shelley phase, 2020), **Genesis** (planned for 2022), **Chronos** (in planning), **Crypsinous** (no deployment planned for Cardano).

**Ouroboros BFT**: a version of **Ouroboros** deployed in May 2020 to prepare Cardano for decentralization as part of the Shelley development phase. 

**Ouroboros Chronos**: a version of **Ouroboros** designed to use a system clock based on blockchain technology. This removes the potential for attacks on blockchains that rely on external time sources such as the internet’s Network Time Protocol. 

**Ouroboros Classic**: a version of **Ouroboros** deployed on Cardano in December 2017. It established the foundation for an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake consensus protocol. 

**Ouroboros Crypsinous**: the Crypsinous version of **Ouroboros** aims to provide security against adaptive attacks and introduces secure encryption relying on Snarks. Crypsinous is currently not planned for deployment on Cardano. 

**Ouroboros Genesis**: this version of **Ouroboros** is planned to be deployed in 2022. Genesis adds a novel chain selection rule that enables new or offline parties to safely rejoin the blockchain without a need to do so from the genesis block. This provides the same security guarantees and simplifies the bootstrapping procedure for **nodes** that were offline for a long period of time. 

**Ouroboros Praos**: this version of **Ouroboros** was deployed in August 2020. Praos introduced decentralized block production by **stake pools**. It also implemented a novel incentive mechanism for participating in block production and introduced mechanisms to defend against Sybil attacks.

**Peer-to-peer (P2P)**: Cardano **nodes** connect to each other directly, without relying on any intermediary. Direct communication means the network is faster and more efficient. Also, because no single point of potential failure exists, the **network** is more resilient. P2P also simplifies the process of running a relay node (one of the nodes run by stake pool operators, which does not produce blocks) or a block-producing node to validate transactions on the network faster.

**Plutus**: a programming language and a set of tools for writing and testing **smart contracts** to be used on Cardano. Plutus is based on **Haskell** and provides a safe, full-stack programming environment. 

[Plutus Pioneer program](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/): a scheme to recruit and train developers to write **Plutus** smart contracts on Cardano. Participants gain access to a [set of courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igV7kMXcdpw) about how to code in both **Haskell** and Plutus. The program is interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with access to experts in the language. 

[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/index): a decentralized innovation fund for Cardano projects set up in 2020. Within two years, 30,000 members had set hundreds of projects underway with a treasury worth $1 billion worth of ada. The project marked the start of Cardano’s **Voltaire** phase and is one of the world’s largest examples of on-chain **governance**.

**RealFi**: [real world finance](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/). An **IOG** initiative started in Africa in 2021 to provide people with fair opportunities in terms of finance and identity management. RealFi aims to deliver real finance for real people, creating value and opportunity for everyone across the globe.

**Relay node**: one of the nodes (or processes) run by the Cardano **node**. It connects to at least one other relay and a block-producing node to share information in the network. See **networking** for details.

**Research**: Cardano's core elements are based on academic research led by the [Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain). Once an idea has been proven and tested mathematically by computer scientists, it is implemented as code by software engineers, with the key parts written in Haskell. Changes to the blockchain are then verified on a testnet before being released. IOG’s research teams have published more than 100 papers, most of which have been peer-reviewed at academic conferences. According to Google Scholar, the original [Ouroboros paper has been cited more than 1,200 times](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=ouroboros&btnG=). There are more than 30 IOG staff with a Scholar profile and they have been cited about 70,000 times in total.

**Scalability**: the ability of a system to handle more and more work. This is a vital property for a blockchain or it will become slower and more expensive to use. Addressing the scaling problems of earlier blockchains was a founding aim of Cardano and is the focus of the **Basho** stage of development.

**Script**: **smart contract** conditions coded to be automatically executed on the blockchain.

**Shelley**: the second phase of Cardano development in which network decentralization was delivered in 2021.

**Sidechain**: a blockchain that runs independently alongside the main chain and is linked to it. Transactions are transferred to the sidechain for processing and the results are sent back, thus taking a load off the main chain. This improves speed, lowers execution fees, and increases overall throughput.

**Slashing**: a penalty charge on some proof-of-stake blockchains for dishonest behavior by network validators. There is no slashing on Cardano. Instead, **Ouroboros** provides incentives for good behavior. Each **stake pool operator** pledges funds to their pool to make it more attractive and earn a higher percentage of rewards. Dishonest behavior will result in loss of rewards. Leading-edge game theory techniques have contributed to this strategy.

**Slot**: the primary unit of time used by the **Ouroboros** algorithm. In current Cardano versions, a slot is exactly one second. Slots that are inhabited by **blocks** are called _active slots_. In early 2022, Cardano parameters set one in 20 slots as active, so the average block time is 20 seconds.

**Slot leader**: a **stake pool** that has the right to create a **block** on Cardano within the current **slot**. The selection process is based on the proportion of **ada** delegated to each pool.

**Smart contracts**: programs written to self-execute when certain pre-determined conditions are met. On Cardano, contracts can be written in **Plutus**, **Marlowe**, or **Haskell**. Such contracts are the basis of decentralized finance (**DeFi**). 

**SMASH**: stake pool metadata aggregation server, which is designed to track and maintain stake pool **metadata** to ensure its validity. 

**Stablecoin**: a cryptocurrency whose value is held constant against one or more other assets. The assets may be a ‘basket’ of currencies, a single currency (eg, the US dollar or the euro), commodities such as gold or silver, stocks, or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that maintain a low deviation from their target price and so are useful to store or exchange value. Their built-in mechanisms remove price volatility.

**Stake**: every ada holder has a stake in the network that they can **delegate** to a pool from their wallet. The process is safe because no ada leaves the user’s wallet.  

**Stake pool**: a computer server running the Cardano **node** to validate transactions and produce **blocks**. Each pool holds the combined stake of many ada owners in a single entity, or pool. Rewards earned by the pool are shared between the operator and their stakeholders.

**Stake pool operator**: a person or organization that takes responsibility for setting up and keeping the pool running. This usually entails owning or renting a server, holding the key to the pool, and maintaining and monitoring the node.

**Staking**: on Cardano, stake pool operators earn rewards for running the **nodes** that support the **network** and produce **blocks**. Staking means committing funds to a **pool** to support these activities. Cardano has non-custodial staking, meaning that there are no locking periods, and ada owners can spend their staked funds at any time. 

**Sustainability**: Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain and has been estimated to use [electricity equivalent to 57 US homes](https://carbon-ratings.com/), which can be met by a single wind turbine. The founders of Cardano set out to tackle the unsustainability of proof-of-work blockchains at the outset. In 2021, academics and researchers reckoned that [Bitcoin](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) and [Ethereum](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption/) used as much power as a country the size of Argentina – 100,000 times as much energy as all the proof-of-stake blockchains.

**Testnet**: a prototype network where users can experiment with the new features and code to provide feedback before a live **mainnet** launch. 

**Throughput**: the volume of data processed by a system in a given amount of time.

**Token**: a cryptographic token that represents a footprint of value defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity. A token can be **fungible** (tradable) or **non-fungible** (unique), and act as a payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.

**Tokenization**: the process of representing real-world **assets** with digital tokens.

**Token burning:** the process of removing tokens from circulation, which reduces the number of coins in use.

**Token minting**: the process of creating tokens.

**TPS**: transactions per second. A measure of the level of activity on a blockchain. Because blockchain transactions differ from traditional payments (and between systems) by their functionality and volume, throughput is a better metric.

**Transaction (tx)**: the process of sending or receiving assets on the blockchain.

**Treasury**: 5% of all earned rewards every epoch are put into a pot to fund Cardano. During the **Voltaire** development phase, treasury reserves will be used for development, system improvements, and to ensure the long-term **sustainability** of the platform.

**Third-generation blockchain**: a blockchain that aims to resolve fundamental issues of the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum). Third-generation blockchains focus on improved **scalability**, **interoperability**, and self-sustainability. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain. 

**UTXO**: unspent transaction output. An accounting model used by blockchains to track users’ funds and their distribution within accounts. The UTXO accounting model guarantees security, data privacy, and scalability at the core of financial activities.

**UTXO Alliance**:a group formed to encourage collaboration on making the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model more scalable, secure, and interoperable. Formed by [Input Output Global](https://iog.io/), [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/en/), [Nervos](https://www.nervos.org/), [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com/en/), and [Topl](https://www.topl.co/).

**Voltaire**: the fifth phase of Cardano development in which **treasury** and **governance** capabilities are being delivered. 

**Wallet**: software to manage cryptocurrency balances and make transactions. ‘**Light’ wallets** for Cardano such as **Yoroi** are designed for fast, easy access via browser or on  a mobile phone; full node wallets such as **Daedalus** are designed for desktops. While they require a high-spec machine and regular syncing, they are the most secure (non-hardware) wallet and help maintain the network by downloading a full copy of the blockchain each time they are used.

[Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/): a **light wallet** for daily use with Cardano. Developed by **Emurgo**.
