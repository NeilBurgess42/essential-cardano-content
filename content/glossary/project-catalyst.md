[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/index): a decentralized innovation fund for Cardano projects set up in 2020. Within two years, 30,000 members had set hundreds of projects underway with a treasury worth $1 billion worth of ada. The project marked the start of Cardano’s **Voltaire** phase and is one of the world’s largest examples of on-chain **governance**.
