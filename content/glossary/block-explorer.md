A web-based tool or application that allows users to explore and navigate a blockchain network. It provides a user-friendly interface to search, view, and retrieve information about transactions, blocks, addresses, and other data recorded on the blockchain.

On the Cardano blockchain we can use block explorers like [explorer.cardano.org](//explorer.cardano.org), [cardanoscan.io](//cardanoscan.io), and [cexplorer.io](//cexplorer.io).
