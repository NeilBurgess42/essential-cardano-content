Refers to a cryptographic key pair associated with a stake address. Stake keys give you access to any rewards cash held in the stake address, as well as the ability to delegate the wallet to a pool to earn staking rewards.

Note that ADA holders can have multiple stake keys and can delegate their ADA to different stake pools simultaneously.
