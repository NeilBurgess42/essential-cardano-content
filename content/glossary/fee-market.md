Cardano's [fee strategy](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/21/plutus-fee-estimator-find-out-the-cost-of-transacting-on-cardano/) is based primarily on market demand rather than the actual supply. Research continues to be done on how **Cardano** can evolve to offer a fair structure of [fee tiers](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/26/network-traffic-and-tiered-pricing/) that provides the best balance between managing demand and maintaining reasonable costs. Ultimately, the Cardano community will vote on whether or not to implement this tiered system.
