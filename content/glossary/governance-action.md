A Governance Action is a proposal that gets submitted On-Chain for voting. It is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction. Governance actions have an expiration period, after which the action cannot be enacted.Â 

Any ada holder can submit a governance action for a vote on-chain. Once the action is recorded on the ledger, voters submit voting transactions.
