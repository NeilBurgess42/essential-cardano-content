The total amount of stake that a stake pool controls. It combines the stake that is owned by the pool operator with any stake that has been delegated to the pool by other ada holders. It can be measured as a total ada amount (e.g., 3 million ada), or as a percentage of the total supply of ada within the network (e.g., 5%).
