FOMO stands for "Fear Of Missing Out"

It's a feeling of anxiety or apprehension that one might miss out on a rewarding or exciting experience that others are having. FOMO can have a negative impact on mental health, as it can lead to stress, dissatisfaction, and a sense of loneliness or isolation.
