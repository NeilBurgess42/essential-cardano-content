[Adrestia](https://input-output-hk.github.io/adrestia/) is a collection of products that simplify integration with Cardano. It is made of several application programming interfaces (APIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and software development kits (SDKs). Alternatively, Adrestia may also refer to the team working on the project itself.
