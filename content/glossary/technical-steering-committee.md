Based at Intersect, the technical steering committee (TSC) is an advisory group that ensures Cardano's governance is founded upon sound technical awareness and best practices. The TSC will cover a broad spectrum of technical aspects of Cardanoâ€™s network and form working groups focused on particular domains.
