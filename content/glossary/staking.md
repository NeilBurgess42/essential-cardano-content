On Cardano, stake pool operators earn rewards for running the [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) that support the [network](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking) and produce [blocks](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block). Staking means committing funds to a [pool](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool) to support these activities. Cardano has [non-custodial staking](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/liquid-democracy), meaning that there are no locking periods, and ada owners can spend their staked funds at any time.
