**Staking**: on Cardano, stake pool operators earn rewards for running the **nodes** that support the **network** and produce **blocks**. Staking means committing funds to a **pool** to support these activities. Cardano has non-custodial staking, meaning that there are no locking periods, and ada owners can spend their staked funds at any time.
