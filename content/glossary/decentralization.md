**Decentralization**: the property of a system that provides independence from a central governing authority. Cardano is supported by more than 3,000 **stake pool operators** across the globe who help validate network activities. **Peer-to-peer** connections and fair **governance** using [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) and **Voltaire** all contribute to Cardanoâ€™s decentralization mission.
