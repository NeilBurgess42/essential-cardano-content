**Decentralization**: the property of a system that provides independence from a central governing authority. Cardano is supported by more than 3,000 [stake pool operators](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator) across the globe who help validate network activities. [Peer-to-peer](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) connections and fair [governance](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/governance) using [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/) and [Voltaire](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/voltaire) all contribute to Cardanoâ€™s decentralization mission.
