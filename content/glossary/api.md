short for **_Application Programming Interfaces_** - are crucial tools in blockchain technology that allow different software applications to interact and communicate with each other.  
  
APIs play a significant role in enabling developers to build applications, access blockchain data, and create functionalities that interact with the Blockchain in general, and specifically Cardano.   
  
There are some typical APIs on the Cardano blockchain, such as:  
\- Cardano Node API: provides a Node API that allows developers to interact with the Cardano node  
\- GraphQL API: allows developers to query specific data they need from the blockchain.
