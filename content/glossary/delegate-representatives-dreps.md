Delegated Representatives (DReps) are a new role introduced in the Age of Voltaire as part of the governance model proposed under CIP-1694. DReps, stake pool operators, and the Constitutional Committee are responsible for voting on governance actions. Any ada holder can register as a DRep.

DReps will play a crucial role in the decision-making process within the Cardano ecosystem, contributing to the democratic nature of the governance model. Ada holders may delegate their ada voting power to representatives who they feel are best equipped (for example, through deeper technological expertise) to best represent their interests.
