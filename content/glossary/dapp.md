**DApp**: a digital (decentralized) application that runs on the blockchain. Just like a mobile app runs on your iOS or Android device, a Cardano DApp runs on the Cardano blockchain. There are various categories of DApps, such as [DeFi](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/decentralized-finance-defi) products, [NFT](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft) markets, wallets, exchanges, games, and more.
