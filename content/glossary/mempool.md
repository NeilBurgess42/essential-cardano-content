How a [node](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) stores information about unconfirmed [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx). The mempool is essentially a holding area for transactions that haven't been included in a [block](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block) yet.
