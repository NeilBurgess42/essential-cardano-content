Software to manage cryptocurrency balances and make transactions. [‘Light’ wallets](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/light-wallet) for Cardano such as [Yoroi](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/yoroi) are designed for fast, easy access via browser or on a mobile phone; full node wallets such as [Daedalus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/daedalus) are designed for desktops. While they require a high-spec machine and regular syncing, they are the most secure (non-hardware) wallet and help maintain the network by downloading a full copy of the blockchain each time they are used.
