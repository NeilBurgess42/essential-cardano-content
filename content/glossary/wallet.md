**Wallet**: software to manage cryptocurrency balances and make transactions. ‘**Light’ wallets** for Cardano such as **Yoroi** are designed for fast, easy access via browser or on  a mobile phone; full node wallets such as **Daedalus** are designed for desktops. While they require a high-spec machine and regular syncing, they are the most secure (non-hardware) wallet and help maintain the network by downloading a full copy of the blockchain each time they are used.
