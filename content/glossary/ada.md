Ada is Cardanoâ€™s native currency, which is named after Ada Lovelace, the English mathematician and programmer.

Ada can be used to pay transaction [fees](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/fee) on the Cardano network and can also be delegated as [stake](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake) to a [stake pool](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool), helping to secure the Cardano blockchain. Delegating ada allows the user to receive rewards for doing so. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days, i.e. every [epoch](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/epoch).

Ada has six decimal places and these fractions of ada are called [lovelaces](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/lovelace). They can be thought of as cents to a dollar.
