ADA is Cardanoâ€™s native currency and it is named after Ada Lovelace, the English mathematician and programmer.

ADA can be used to pay transaction fees on the Cardano network and can also be delegated as [stake](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake) to a [stake pool](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool), helping to further secure the Cardano blockchain. Delegating ADA opens the user up to receiving rewards for doing so. All rewards are distributed in ADA and this is done every 5 days, i.e. every [epoch](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/epoch).

ADA has six decimal places and these fractions of ADA are called [Lovelaces](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/epochhttps://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/lovelace). They can be thought of like cents to a dollar.
