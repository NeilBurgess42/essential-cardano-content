**Sustainability**: Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain and has been estimated to use [electricity equivalent to 57 US homes](https://carbon-ratings.com/), which can be met by a single wind turbine. The founders of Cardano set out to tackle the unsustainability of proof-of-work blockchains at the outset. In 2021, academics and researchers reckoned that [Bitcoin](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index) and [Ethereum](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption/) used as much power as a country the size of Argentina â€“ 100,000 times as much energy as all the proof-of-stake blockchains.
