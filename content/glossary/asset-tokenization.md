The process of converting real-world or digital assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. On Cardano, the network supports the creation of custom tokens through its [native token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/native-tokens) standard, allowing users to represent any asset or utility directly on the blockchain.

Use Cases include fractional ownership of real estate, digital representation of art and collectibles, tokenization of financial assets, and intellectual property rights.
