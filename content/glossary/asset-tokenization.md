The process of converting real-world or digital assets into digital tokens on the Cardano blockchain. On Cardano blockchain, the network supports the creation of custom tokens through its [native token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/native-tokens) standard, allowing users to represent any asset or utility directly on the blockchain.

Use Cases: Includes fractional ownership of real estate, digital representation of art and collectibles, tokenization of financial assets, and intellectual property rights.
