known as a valid block that is rejected by the network because another block with the same height was added to the blockchain at nearly the same time.  
The reason a block becomes an orphan block on the Cardano blockchain is because the stake pool creating that block did not win in the [Slot battle](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/slot-battles) or [Height battles](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/height-battles). Additionally, a block becomes an orphan when it is not propagated across the entire network within the allowed time.
