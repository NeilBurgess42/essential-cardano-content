APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is a financial metric used to calculate the annualized rate of return on an investment or the annual interest rate on borrowing. It is commonly used to measure the potential earnings or costs associated with staking, lending, or providing liquidity on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

Currently there are many DApps built on the Cardano blockchain for users to make a return.
