A data structure used in transaction outputs to convey various pieces of information. All addresses carry a network-discriminant tag to distinguish between different networks (e.g., mainnet or testnet) and a proof of ownership (i.e., a proof of who owns the transaction output). Some addresses also carry delegation choices or script references.
