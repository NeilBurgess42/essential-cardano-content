A toolkit developed by [Input Output Global (IOG)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/iog) and a team of specialist engineers, used to build unique [sidechains](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/sidechain) that extend and [scale](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/scalability) Cardano without jeopardizing its stability or security.

The toolkit allows a sidechain to have its own [consensus](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/consensus) algorithm and features. The sidechain is connected to the Cardano main chain through a [bridge](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/blockchain-bridge) that allows asset transfer between chains. The finality of blocks is determined through a consensus mechanism that relies on the security of the main chain.

The [toolkit consists of](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/sidechain-toolkit/introduction) Cardano Plutus scripts, a chain follower, and the sidechain module.
