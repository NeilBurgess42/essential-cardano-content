Aims to enable interconnection between blockchains. Cross-chain transfers and the ‘internet of blockchains’ will grant enhanced user experience and functionality. [Sidechains](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/sidechain) and the AGIX [ERC20 converter](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/erc20-converter) support Cardano's interoperability.
