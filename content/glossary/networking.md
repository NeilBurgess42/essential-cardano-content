**Networking**: a technical infrastructure linking Cardano **nodes** in one unified system to process transactions. **Stake pool operators** run Cardano **nodes** that communicate with other nodes to share information about new blocks and transactions. This includes three processes: each operator runs a block-producing node (the node that verifies and creates a block) and two relay nodes (which donâ€™t produce blocks but share information). Wallets and exchanges operate as nodes too. They can help verify blockchain activities by running a block-producing node, which is connected to other relays.
