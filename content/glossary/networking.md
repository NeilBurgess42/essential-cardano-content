**Networking**: a technical infrastructure linking Cardano [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) in one unified system to process transactions. [Stake pool operators](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator) run Cardano nodes that communicate with other nodes to share information about new blocks and transactions. This includes three processes: each operator runs a block-producing node (the node that verifies and creates a block) and two relay nodes (which donâ€™t produce blocks but share information). Wallets and exchanges operate as nodes too. They can help verify blockchain activities by running a block-producing node, which is connected to other relays.
