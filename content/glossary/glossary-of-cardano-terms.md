*   [Blockfrost](https://docs.blockfrost.io/), an instant and scalable Cardano API for free
    
*   [Carp](https://github.com/dcSpark/carp), a modular indexer for Cardano with an SQL Postgres backend
    
*   [Kupo](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#section/Overview), aÂ  fast, lightweight and configurable chain-index for the Cardano blockchain
    
*   [Marconi](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/tree/main/marconi), the Cardano blockchain indexer for dApp developers
    
*   [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/), a lightweight bridge interface for cardano-node
