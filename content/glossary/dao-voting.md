refers to the process by which stakeholders participate in governance decisions by casting votes on proposals and protocol upgrades. Leveraging the decentralized nature of Cardano, stakeholders use their voting power, determined by their holdings of ada, to influence the direction and development of the ecosystem.

Through transparent and auditable voting mechanisms, such as [Catalyst](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/project-catalyst), stakeholders engage in democratic decision-making, shaping the future of Cardano's development, funding allocation, and protocol evolution.
