A genesis block is the first block of a blockchain network. It is the foundation upon which the entire blockchain is built. The genesis block is usually created by the network's creator or founder, and it contains a unique set of data that defines the initial state of the blockchain.

The genesis block is different from all subsequent blocks in the network, as it does not reference any previous blocks. Instead, it contains a special "coinbase" transaction that generates the initial supply of cryptocurrency or tokens for the network.

In Cardano blockchain, the genesis block was created at 2017/09/23 21:44:51 UTC
