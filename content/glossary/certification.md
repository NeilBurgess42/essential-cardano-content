**Certification**: a high level of assurance is key when developing and working with [smart contracts](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/smart-contracts) and decentralized applications ([DApps](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dapp)). Applications in Cardanoâ€™s [dAppStore](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dappstore) will have the option to meet and display up to three [levels of certification](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/25/new-certification-levels-for-smart-contracts-on-cardano/).
