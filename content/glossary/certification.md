**Certification**: a high level of assurance is key when developing and working with **smart contracts** and decentralized applications (**DApps**). Applications in Cardanoâ€™s **dAppStore** will have the option to meet and display up to three [levels of certification](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/25/new-certification-levels-for-smart-contracts-on-cardano/).
