**Delegation**: the process whereby ada owners can assign their funds using their wallets to a **stake pool**. This helps maintain a computer server to run a node on the Cardano **network**. In exchange, delegators receive a share of the pool’s total rewards. Delegating your ada is totally safe because no **ada** leaves the user’s wallet.
