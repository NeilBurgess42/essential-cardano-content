The process whereby ada owners can assign their funds using their wallets to a [stake pool](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool). This helps maintain a computer server to run a node on the Cardano [network](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking). In exchange, delegators receive a share of the pool’s total rewards. Delegating your ada is totally safe because no ada leaves the user’s wallet.
