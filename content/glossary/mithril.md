**Mithril**: the Cardano upgrade to streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications. [Mithril](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) retains strong security settings and its uses include secure voting, data exchange between sidechains, and data synchronization within light wallets. It is part of the [Basho](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/basho) phase and will be implemented in 2022.
