The Cardano upgrade to [streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency). [Mithril](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/) retains strong security settings and its uses include secure voting, data exchange between sidechains, and data synchronization within light wallets.
