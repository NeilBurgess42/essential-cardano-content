This version of [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros) is planned to be deployed in 2023. [Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesis-composable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/) adds a novel chain selection rule that enables new or offline parties to safely rejoin the blockchain without a need to do so from the genesis block. This provides the same security guarantees and simplifies the bootstrapping procedure for [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) that were offline for a long period of time.
