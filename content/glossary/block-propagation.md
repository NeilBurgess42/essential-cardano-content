Typically refers to the process of transmitting newly created blocks to all nodes on the network so that they can validate and add the block to their copy of the blockchain. Efficient block propagation is important for the overall performance and security of a blockchain network.

On the Cardano blockchain, the propagation time should be less than 1 second to ensure that blocks are less likely to become orphaned.
