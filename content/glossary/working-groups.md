A working group brings experts and committed community members together to discuss a specific topic.Each group sets its own goals regarding solutions to drive ecosystem success and adoption.Â 

Intersect is currently facilitating the creation and bootstrapping of these expert groups. The ultimate goal is community empowerment to self-mobilize and collaborate on decision-making processes and

solution implementation.
