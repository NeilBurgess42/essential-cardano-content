**Hard fork**: an irreversible change to a blockchain protocol. Cardano uses a [hard fork combinator](https://iohk.io/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/) to ensure smooth upgrades. Unlike earlier blockchains, Cardano hard forks save the chain history and do not cause disruption for users.
