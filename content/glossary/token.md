A cryptographic token that represents a footprint of value defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity. A token can be [fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/fungible-token) (tradable) or [non-fungible](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft) (unique), and act as a payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.
