Anzens is a DeFi platform created & operated by EMURGO; one of Cardano's founding entities, that enables Cardano Community to tokenize real-world assets.  
  
To be launched in 2023, the first asset that will be tokenize is the US Dollars.  
  
Through Anzens, people can mint $USDA, Cardano-native fully-regulated fiat-backed stablecoin that is pegged to the value of US Dollars.  
  
Moving forward, Anzens will enable people to mint other currencies (e.g. EUR, JPY, GBP, etc.) as well as other real-world assets (e.g. gold, property, etc.)
