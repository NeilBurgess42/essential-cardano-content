A significant protocol upgrade to the Cardano blockchain that will soon be implemented using [Cardanoâ€™s HFC approach](https://docs.cardano.org/core-concepts/about-hard-forks). Its objective is to make the blockchain more robust and [scalable](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/scalability), increasing [throughput](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/throughput) and reducing latency in block transmission.

The Vasil hard fork combinator will see the implementation of [block diffusion pipelining](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/01/introducing-pipelining-cardanos-consensus-layer-scaling-solution/) and adds reference inputs, inline datums, and reference scripts through four key [CIPs](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cip) ([CIP-31](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip31/), [CIP-32](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip32/), [CIP-33](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip33/), [CIP-40](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/216)).

These changes allow for the [network to process a larger number of transactions](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/03/21/increasing-the-transaction-throughput-of-cardano/), improving the consistency of block propagation times without affecting network performance.
