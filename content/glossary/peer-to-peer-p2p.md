**Peer-to-peer (P2P)**: Cardano **nodes** connect to each other directly, without relying on any intermediary. Direct communication means the network is faster and more efficient. Also, because no single point of potential failure exists, the **network** is more resilient. P2P also simplifies the process of running a relay node (one of the nodes run by stake pool operators, which does not produce blocks) or a block-producing node to validate transactions on the network faster.
