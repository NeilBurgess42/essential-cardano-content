Cardano [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) connect to each other directly, without relying on any intermediary. Direct communication means the network is faster and more efficient. Also, because no single point of potential failure exists, the [network](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking) is more resilient. P2P also simplifies the process of running a relay node (one of the [nodes](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node) run by [stake pool operators](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/stake-pool-operator), which does not produce [blocks](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block)) or a block-producing node to validate [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx) on the network faster.
