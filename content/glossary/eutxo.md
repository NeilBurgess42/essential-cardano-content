**EUTXO**: the accounting model used by Cardano. This is an extended version of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output model. EUTXO brings greater security, ensures fees are predictable, and can process a large number of transactions in parallel. ​​It also supports different types of **assets** and **smart contracts**, without compromising the advantages of **UTXO**.
