A measure of the level of activity on a blockchain. Because blockchain [transactions](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/transaction-tx) differ from traditional payments (and between systems) by their functionality and volume, [throughput](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/throughput) is a better metric. Whereas Ethereum’s TPS only considers individual transactions, the [eUTxO](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/eutxo) accounting model allows for multiple transactions to be included in a single one. Cardano’s TPS, therefore, cannot accurately be compared to Ethereum’s TPS as 1:1.
