A participant on the Cardano blockchain tasked with generating new blocks by validating transactions and adding them to the chain using the Ouroboros protocol. Selected based on stake, performance, and randomness, block producers operate within stake pools, aiming to maintain decentralization and security. Incentivized by rewards in ADA, they encourage community participation in maintaining the network's integrity.
