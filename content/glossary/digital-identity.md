refers to a secure and verifiable representation of an individual, organization, or entity in the digital realm. It encompasses personal attributes, credentials, and biometric data that are cryptographically stored and managed on the blockchain, providing users with control over their identity and enhancing privacy, security, and interoperability across digital platforms.
