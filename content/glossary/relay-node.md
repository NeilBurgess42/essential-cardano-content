**Relay node**: one of the nodes (or processes) run by the Cardano [node](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/node). It connects to at least one other relay and a block-producing node to share information in the network. See [networking](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/networking) for details.
