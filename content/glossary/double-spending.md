The act of spending the same coin/token more than once. It is a potential issue in decentralized digital payment systems where transactions are recorded on a blockchain or a similar distributed ledger.

On the Cardano blockchain, double spending cannot occur due to the [Extended UTXO](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/eutxo) accounting model.
