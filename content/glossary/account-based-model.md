Ethereum’s transaction model through which assets are represented as balances within different accounts. Balances are updated as assets are transferred from one account to another. This model differs from Cardano’s [EUTXO](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/eutxo) model which improves on Bitcoin’s basic [UTXO](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/utxo) model.
