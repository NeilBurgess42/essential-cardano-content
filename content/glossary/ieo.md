IEO stands for "Initial Exchange Offering". It is a type of fundraising method used by cryptocurrency startups to raise capital through a cryptocurrency exchange. In an IEO, the startup partners with an exchange that conducts the offering on behalf of the startup.

Investors participate in the IEO by purchasing the startup's tokens or coins directly from the exchange. The exchange typically charges a fee for hosting the IEO, and the startup benefits from the exchange's established user base and marketing efforts
