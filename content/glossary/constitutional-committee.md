The Constitutional Committee (CC) is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694 alongside SPOs and DReps. CIP-1694 defines the CC as a committee that represents a set of individuals or entities that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution's principles are upheld and enforced.

As described in CIP-1694, each Constitutional Committee (CC) member has one vote, adhering to a “one member, one vote” principle. CC members are responsible for reviewing whether governance actions align with the Cardano constitution. The CC must meet a specific quorum defined by a protocol parameter to pass a governance action.

CC members may vote on any governance action and decide if it goes against the Constitution. The CC cannot modify governance actions once presented for a vote. The CC will be initially instituted for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and evolve as the governance model advances.
