**Determinism**: [the predictability of costs](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/) for a blockchain transaction. Cardano uses deterministic pricing, which means you know how much a transaction will cost before you make it. Protocol parameters, rather than network traffic, govern pricing on Cardano, so prices remain stable and low. No fees are charged for failed transactions, which differentiates Cardano from indeterministic chains like Ethereum.
