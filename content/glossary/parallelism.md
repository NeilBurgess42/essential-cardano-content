A systemâ€™s ability to allow multiple actors to progress on their tasks simultaneously without interfering with each other. On Cardano, parallelism goes hand in hand with [concurrency](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/concurrency), another key advantage of the EUTXO model. As parallelism aligns the transactions, [concurrency processes them simultaneously](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/). Thus, the maximum achievable parallelism increases as the level of concurrency increases. Through this process, performance and throughput improve.
