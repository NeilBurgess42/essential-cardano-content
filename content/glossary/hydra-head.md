**Hydra Head**: the first of several Hydra protocols, and the basis of improving Cardano's **scalability**. Each [Hydra Head](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/03/implementing-hydra-heads-the-first-step-towards-the-full-hydra-vision/) works as an off-chain mini ledger, similar but faster than the main on-chain ledger, shared between small groups of participants. Many complex protocols can be added as layers on top of Cardano.
