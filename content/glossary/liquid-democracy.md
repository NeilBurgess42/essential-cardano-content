A hybrid of direct and representative democracy to be used in [Voltaire](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/voltaire). Liquid democracy enables the [treasury](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/treasury) system to take advantage of expert knowledge in a voting process, as well as ensure that all ada holders are granted an opportunity to vote. For each project, a voter can either vote directly or delegate their voting power to a member of the community who is an expert on the topic.
