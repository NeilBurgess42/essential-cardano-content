Cardanoâ€™s [delegation](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/delegation) mechanism is based on a liquid democracy, meaning that staked funds are never locked and can be spent at any time. Other platforms use a third-party protocol to make staked tokens liquid, which has the potential to introduce security problems.
