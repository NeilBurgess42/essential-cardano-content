**ERC20 converter**: a tool that allows ERC20 tokens to be used on Cardano. Users benefit from a higher capacity of transaction processing, lower fees, and the greater security offered by the [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros) consensus protocol. [SingularityNETâ€™s](https://singularitynet.io/) AGIX token is the first token that users can move between Ethereum and Cardano.
