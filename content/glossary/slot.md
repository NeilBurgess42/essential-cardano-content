**Slot**: the primary unit of time used by the **Ouroboros** algorithm. In current Cardano versions, a slot is exactly one second. Slots that are inhabited by **blocks** are called _active slots_. In early 2022, Cardano parameters set one in 20 slots as active, so the average block time is 20 seconds.
