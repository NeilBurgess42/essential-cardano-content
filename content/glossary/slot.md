The primary unit of time used by the [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros) algorithm. In current Cardano versions, a slot is exactly one second. Slots that are inhabited by [blocks](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/block) are called _active slots_. In early 2022, Cardano parameters set one in 20 slots as active, so the average block time is 20 seconds.
