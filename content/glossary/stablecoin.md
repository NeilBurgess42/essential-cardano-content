**Stablecoin**: a cryptocurrency whose value is held constant against one or more other assets. The assets may be a ‘basket’ of currencies, a single currency (eg, the US dollar or the euro), commodities such as gold or silver, stocks, or other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins include mechanisms that maintain a low deviation from their target price and so are useful to store or exchange value. Their built-in mechanisms remove price volatility.
