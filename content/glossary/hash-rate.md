Hash rate refers to the measurement of the processing power of a blockchain network, particularly in the context of [proof of work (PoW)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-proof-of-work-pow) consensus algorithms. It measures the number of hash operations that a network can perform in a second.

In a PoW, miners use specialized hardware to perform complex mathematical calculations, known as hash functions, to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The hash rate is a measure of the speed at which this process occurs.

The hash rate is typically measured in hashes per second (H/s), kilohashes per second (KH/s), megahashes per second (MH/s), gigahashes per second (GH/s), terahashes per second (TH/s), or even petahashes per second (PH/s).

Cardano uses a [proof of stake](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism so there is no concept of hash rate on Cardano.
