Sometimes called atomic cross-chain trading, atomic swap is the exchange of one cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency without the need to trust a third party. It’s called atomic (referring to the Greek term atomon, i.e. indivisible) since there aren’t two separate transfers, but one single transfer that does the swap at once.
