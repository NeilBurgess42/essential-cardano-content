In the [Cardano sidechain toolkit](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/sidechain-toolkit), a sidechain certificate creator is a [sidechain](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/sidechain) component whose responsibilities are:

● To accrue data on the sidechain that needs to be ferried to the main chain (hoard)

● To inform the governing committee (block producers) of the sidechain that it is time to

certify the hoarded data (prove)

● To make the proof available for the ferrying mechanism (rely).
