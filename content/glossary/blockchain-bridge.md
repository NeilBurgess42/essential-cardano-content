A protocol or platform that allows assets to be ported from one blockchain to another. Blockchain bridges facilitate chain [interoperability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/interoperability), and these bridges can be either bidirectional or one-way. Tokens are locked up on the asset's native chain by either sending them to a smart contract or sending them to the wallet of a custodian. Then, synthetic assets that represent the locked assets are minted on the target chain and set to an address designated by the person who locked the assets.
