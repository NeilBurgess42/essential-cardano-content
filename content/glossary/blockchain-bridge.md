A protocol or platform that allows tokens to be ported from one blockchain to another, where they can be used for payments or to interact with decentralized applications (DApps). Blockchain bridges facilitate chain [interoperability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/interoperability) and can be either bidirectional or unidirectional. Tokens are locked on their native chain by either sending them to a smart contract or sending them to the wallet of a custodian. Then, the equivalents of those tokens are created on the target chain and issued at an address designated by the person who locked the assets.
