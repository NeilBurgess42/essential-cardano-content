A fixed fee, in ada, which the stake pool operator takes from the pool rewards every epoch to cover the costs of running a stake pool. The cost per epoch is subtracted from the total ada rewarded to a pool, before the operator takes their profit margin. Whatever remains is shared proportionally among the delegators.
