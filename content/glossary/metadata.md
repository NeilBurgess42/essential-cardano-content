Information about a digital file. In [smart contracts](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/smart-contracts), metadata sets out the conditions under which a deal should execute. In a [non-fungible token](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/nft), metadata can hold information about the ownership or intellectual rights, among other things.
