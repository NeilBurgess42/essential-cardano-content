refers to a decentralized database shared across multiple nodes, where transactions and data are recorded, stored, and synchronized in a transparent and immutable manner.

Unlike traditional centralized ledgers, distributed ledgers on Cardano are distributed among a network of participants, enabling consensus mechanisms like Ouroboros to validate and agree upon the state of the ledger without the need for a central authority.
