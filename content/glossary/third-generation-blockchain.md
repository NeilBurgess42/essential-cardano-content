**Third-generation blockchain**: a blockchain that aims to resolve fundamental issues of the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum). Third-generation blockchains focus on improved [scalability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/scalability), [interoperability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/interoperability), and [self-sustainability](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/governance). Cardano is a third-generation blockchain.
