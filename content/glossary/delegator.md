an individual or entity that delegates their stake or voting power to a stake pool operator (SPO). SPOs are selected based on the amount of ada they hold or "stake" in the network.

By delegating their stake, delegators entrust the SPO with the responsibility of securing the network and validating transactions. In return, delegators can receive a portion of the rewards that are distributed among all stakeholders.
